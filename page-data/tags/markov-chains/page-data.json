It has different probabilities for different transitions, and when real data is modelled using these chains, a prediction can be obtained. The accuracy of this prediction depends on the accuracy of the probabilistic values.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-purpose\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-purpose\" aria-label=\"the purpose permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Purpose</h1>\n<p>The main purpose of this project was to see how different decisions of quarantine and social distancing can lead to huge changes in the coronavirus data.

A diagram of the 6-state No-Quarantine model is shown below. We start with a population of 10,000 people, and we allow both healthy and sick to stay in one place with no quarantine or isolation at all. This means healthy individuals first contract the virus and are contagious without showing symptoms, contagious people eventually show symptoms, symptomatic people fall sick, sick people become critical, and some critically ill people die. We increment these 6-states into discrete 1-day timesteps. The probability of a person remaining in the same state is 0.9, and the probability of transitioning to the next state is 0.1. I obtained the graph for the Markov chain using Google Sheets, where I multiplied the probabilities of each transition with the number of people in that state for each day, and then plotted the graph of each day’s numbers. If we simulate this Markov chain, all people will eventually die, which is not a favorable scenario at all. This is shown in the results graph below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Image1.png\" alt=\"The Markov Chain\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nThe Markov Chain\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Image2.png\" alt=\"The Markov Chain\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nThe Graph for the Markov Chain\n</p>\n<p>Conclusions: In the first 7 days, 3000 people become contagious without knowing, only 1000 people show symptoms and there is only one death. The “hockey puck” curve really starts rising with only 300 deaths by day 20, by which time 2900 people are symptomatic, 2900 people are contagious healthy and another 1000 fully healthy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-2-markov-chain-in-a-half-quarantine-case\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#example-2-markov-chain-in-a-half-quarantine-case\" aria-label=\"example 2 markov chain in a half quarantine case permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Example 2: Markov Chain in a Half Quarantine case.</h3>\n<p>We now modify the diagram to a 7-state model. Again starting with a population of 10,000 people, we now take half the symptomatic people and quarantine them away from the general population. The probabilities for the Markov chain remain the same so that we can see how much effect quarantine has on the same exact situation.</p>\n<p>These quarantined people are supposed to fully recover on their own. We want to see if this reduces the death rate.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Image3.png\" alt=\"The Markov Chain\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nThe Markov Chain\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Image4.png\" alt=\"The Markov Chain\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nThe Graph for the Markov Chain\n</p>\n<p>Conclusions: There is still a lag. However, by just identifying symptomatic people and quarantining only half of them, we are able to “save” 8350 people. Finally, there are only 1650 deaths.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-implications\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-implications\" aria-label=\"the implications permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Implications</h1>\n<p>I feel that this project shows just how much this situation depends on the response of the human community. From the first example, we see that if people do not quarantine at all, the virus can spread really fast and affect almost the entire population. This is of increased relevance in countries who have successfully countered the first wave of infections and are reopening. Returning to normal life without any precautions at all can have disastrous consequences. By quarantining just half of the total symptomatic population each day, we can save a huge number of people. Thus, this model shows how different decisions can have a huge impact on the result of the same situation, and how we must stay vigilant in order to minimize the damage caused by this pandemic.</p>","id":"ec83c840-b4f0-56cf-a4a1-1f5be121ab36","fields":{"slug":"20-feb-2020-modelling-the-coronavirus-using-markov-chains"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-02-20","title":"20 Feb 2020: Modelling the Coronavirus using Markov Chains","category":"Coding","tags":["Technology","Coronavirus","Markov Chains"],"banner":"/assets/bg/computer-bg-1.jpg"},"timeToRead":3}],"tagName":"Markov Chains"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3824141623"]}
