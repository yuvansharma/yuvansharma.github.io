It has different probabilities for different transitions, and when real data is modelled using these chains, a prediction can be obtained. The accuracy of this prediction depends on the accuracy of the probabilistic values.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-purpose\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-purpose\" aria-label=\"the purpose permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Purpose</h1>\n<p>The main purpose of this project was to see how different decisions of quarantine and social distancing can lead to huge changes in the coronavirus data.

A diagram of the 6-state No-Quarantine model is shown below. We start with a population of 10,000 people, and we allow both healthy and sick to stay in one place with no quarantine or isolation at all. This means healthy individuals first contract the virus and are contagious without showing symptoms, contagious people eventually show symptoms, symptomatic people fall sick, sick people become critical, and some critically ill people die. We increment these 6-states into discrete 1-day timesteps. The probability of a person remaining in the same state is 0.9, and the probability of transitioning to the next state is 0.1. I obtained the graph for the Markov chain using Google Sheets, where I multiplied the probabilities of each transition with the number of people in that state for each day, and then plotted the graph of each day’s numbers. If we simulate this Markov chain, all people will eventually die, which is not a favorable scenario at all. This is shown in the results graph below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Image1.png\" alt=\"The Markov Chain\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nThe Markov Chain\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Image2.png\" alt=\"The Markov Chain\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nThe Graph for the Markov Chain\n</p>\n<p>Conclusions: In the first 7 days, 3000 people become contagious without knowing, only 1000 people show symptoms and there is only one death. The “hockey puck” curve really starts rising with only 300 deaths by day 20, by which time 2900 people are symptomatic, 2900 people are contagious healthy and another 1000 fully healthy.</p>\n<h3 id=\"example-2-markov-chain-in-a-half-quarantine-case\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#example-2-markov-chain-in-a-half-quarantine-case\" aria-label=\"example 2 markov chain in a half quarantine case permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Example 2: Markov Chain in a Half Quarantine case.</h3>\n<p>We now modify the diagram to a 7-state model. Again starting with a population of 10,000 people, we now take half the symptomatic people and quarantine them away from the general population. The probabilities for the Markov chain remain the same so that we can see how much effect quarantine has on the same exact situation.</p>\n<p>These quarantined people are supposed to fully recover on their own. We want to see if this reduces the death rate.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Image3.png\" alt=\"The Markov Chain\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nThe Markov Chain\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Image4.png\" alt=\"The Markov Chain\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nThe Graph for the Markov Chain\n</p>\n<p>Conclusions: There is still a lag.

From the first example, we see that if people do not quarantine at all, the virus can spread really fast and affect almost the entire population. This is of increased relevance in countries who have successfully countered the first wave of infections and are reopening. Returning to normal life without any precautions at all can have disastrous consequences. By quarantining just half of the total symptomatic population each day, we can save a huge number of people. Thus, this model shows how different decisions can have a huge impact on the result of the same situation, and how we must stay vigilant in order to minimize the damage caused by this pandemic.</p>","fields":{"slug":"20-feb-2020-modelling-the-coronavirus-using-markov-chains"},"frontmatter":{"title":"20 Feb 2020: Modelling the Coronavirus using Markov Chains","date":"20.02.2020","category":"Coding","tags":["Technology","Coronavirus","Markov Chains"],"banner":"/assets/bg/computer-bg-1.jpg"},"timeToRead":3}},"pageContext":{"slug":"20-feb-2020-modelling-the-coronavirus-using-markov-chains","prev":{"excerpt":"Introduction As part of my ATDP 2019 Astronomy and Astrophysics Course, we used data from NASA’s WISE telescope to identify brown dwarfs and ULIRGs (Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxies).

Instead of the regular H-H nuclear fusion that occurs and releases energy in stars,\nbrown dwarfs primarily have lithium and deuterium fusion since they don’t quite have the temperature and density required for regular nuclear fusion. Brown dwarfs are very cool and hence\ndim. So, searching for them is difficult, even though they are thought to be more abundant than stars. The WISE telescope searched for IR radiation to identify brown dwarfs since most of the\nlight they emit is infrared.</p>\n<p>A ULIRG is a galaxy which primarily emits infrared light. The primary source of this IR light is dust, which is observed wherever stars are forming. Thus, ULIRGs may be found in galaxies which\nare merging and leading to bursts of star formation, which leads to collection of dust. ULIRGs emit even more light than brown dwarfs at the lower IR wavelengths.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#approach\" aria-label=\"approach permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Approach</h2>\n<p>We started this assignment by downloading the required images from the WISE Image Service. We downloaded the same image in three different wavelength bands, w1 (3.4 µm), w2 (4.6 µm) and w3\n(12 µm). We then used a finder chart to locate 12 different stars on all the 3 wavelengths. This was particularly difficult since some stars were harder to locate on specific wavelengths due to the\nchange in their brightness and intensity as the wavelength changed. It was also very confusing in the beginning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/WiseImage.png\" alt=\"The WISE Image\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\"> The WISE Image</p>\n<p>Using each star’s coordinates and its intensity, we calculated the ratio of the intensities for the different wavelengths. We used the ratios w3:w2 and w2:w1. I wrote a Java program for\ncalculating these values. We then plotted the colour-colour diagram(a kind of graph) for the twelve stars. We identified the brown dwarf by studying the position the stars occupied on the\ncolour-colour diagram.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/ColorColorDiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Color Color Diagram\"></p>\n<p align=\"Center\"> The Color Color Diagram</p>\n<p>Then, we repeated the same for the ULIRGs and identified the ULIRG using another colour- colour diagram. However, we then realised that the object we thought was a ULIRG could just be an\nextreme case of a brown dwarf. So, we used images of the same region from the Hubble Space Telescope(HST) to look at the object, since HST images are much more detailed. Upon intensive\nexamination, we noticed the faint trace of a spiral arm in the HST image, and this confirmed it was indeed an Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This was one of my favourite assignments in this course since I applied Computer Science to Astronomy while learning new things in both fields.

What I really had to do was simulate sunlight realistically. The Eureka moment came when I\nrealized I could use the animating software Blender in order to run a simulation with sunlight and the sundial. I imported the digital design of the sundial into OpenSCAD. The sundial had the\nbasic structure of a conventional one, but it also had slits to display hours, minutes and seconds. It had a pivot joint to adjust for latitude and came as one version for the northern hemisphere\nand a different version for the southern hemisphere.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Sundial1.png\" alt=\"The Mojoptix Sundial in OpenSCAD\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nThe Mojoptix Sundial in OpenSCAD\n</p>\n<p>I made some necessary adjustments and then imported the Sundial into Blender. In Blender, I placed the sundial on a plane, added a source of light and animated it according to the positions of the\nSun at various times of the day. Then, I entered these coordinates into Blender and ran the animation. It worked perfectly on my very first try! The sundial displayed the time of the day in 20-minute\nintervals as the light source went from east to west, simulating the Sun.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mathematical-details\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#mathematical-details\" aria-label=\"mathematical details permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Mathematical Details</h2>\n<p>What was important in this approach was to get the coordinate system of the Sundial correct in 3D space. The alignment was done with respect to 28.5deg North latitude for Delhi. It took some time\nfor me to grasp the trigonometry details of how to calculate the Sun\\rquote s path at each minute of the day. The Sun is positioned at a certain altitude from the horizontal and at a certain azimuth from\ngeographical North. For any sundial arm of length R, the shadow can be calculated using the equations described at many websites. Initially, I tried to understand and program this from the site\n{{\\field{*\\fldinst{HYPERLINK <a href=\"https://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Secliptc.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Secliptc.htm</a> }}{\\fldrslt{<a href=\"https://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Secliptc.htm%5Cul0%5Ccf0%7D%7D%7D%7D%5Cf0%5Cfs22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Secliptc.htm\\ul0\\cf0}}}}\\f0\\fs22</a> . Eventually, I realized that the python pysolar library (from {{\\field{*\\fldinst{HYPERLINK <a href=\"http://www.pysolar.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://www.pysolar.org</a> }}{\\fldrslt{<a href=\"http://www.pysolar.org%5Cul0%5Ccf0%7D%7D%7D%7D%5Cf0%5Cfs22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://www.pysolar.org\\ul0\\cf0}}}}\\f0\\fs22</a>  ) does the same thing more easily. I then used pysolar by writing a python program as below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Sundial2.png\" alt=\"Python program\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nPython program\n</p>\n<p>The output of my python script gives for each time the exact x,y,z coordinates of the Sun. I positioned a light source in Blender at this position and then animated this over the course of the whole\nday.

I managed to use trigonometry for this\nprogram. Most importantly, I was able to prove my sundial worked even though I didn\\rquote t have any 3D printer. I am now generalizing the program for positioning the sundial for any place on Earth for any\ngiven time and day.  I really enjoyed this project because of the new skills that I learnt.</p>","id":"7c79b226-bb35-551d-97e3-5472955f8147","fields":{"slug":"23-apr-2020-a-3-d-printed-digital-sundial"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-04-23","title":"23 Apr 2020: A 3D Printed Digital Sundial","category":"Coding","tags":["3D Printing","Sundial","Animation","Blender"],"banner":"/assets/bg/computer-bg-1.jpg"},"timeToRead":3}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3824141623"]}
