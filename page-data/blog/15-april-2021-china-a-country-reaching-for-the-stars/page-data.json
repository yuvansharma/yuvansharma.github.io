China’s foreign policy is perhaps one of the most intricate and carefully planned in the world today; consequently, it also gives a good idea of what China is aiming to achieve in the decades to come, the countries its vision includes as potential allies, and those it sees as a threat.</p>\n<p>Over the past several years, there have been multiple indications, directly from Chinese leaders and indirectly from their foreign policy decisions, that the country is actively pursuing a position at the top of the global hierarchy. History always provides a suitable lens to study the present; likewise, a look at Chinese history is necessary to fully understand the reasons and motivations behind current Chinese decisions.</p>\n<p>The period from 1839-1949 is often called China’s “Century of Humiliation,” as the Chinese empire was overpowered by Western powers like Britain and France, as well as Russia and Japan. This subjugation experienced by the Chinese empire is regarded as a defeat to be extremely ashamed of in China. It started in 1839 with the First Opium War against Britain when China tried to put an end to the illegal opium trade being carried out by the British since addiction to the drug was having a widespread impact on society. China lost this war badly, and the Second Opium War, in which France fought with Britain, had the same result. Subsequently, China lost a number of wars, especially against Japan, and the rulers also had to sign several treaties after each loss, giving away valuable territory; Britain additionally made China increase the number of ports that allowed British traders in an effort to increase British influence and trade in the region.</p>\n<p>These continuous losses finally led to the formation of the modern state of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Since then, the nation’s ambitions have been rising steeply. In a 2017 speech at the Party Congress, President Xi Jinping pledged to achieve the “Great Rejuvenation” of the country by 2049, the one-hundredth anniversary of the nation. The phrase is not new; Xi has been using this phrase to refer to sustainable yet accelerated development and a return to great heights since 2012. However, his 2017 speech provided more specificity and offered a multistage plan to achieve rejuvenation in a gradual manner across three time periods: 2020, 2035, and 2050. An important and especially relevant example his speech included was the military. Xi explained that the military would achieve mechanization by 2020, modernization by 2035, and would become a “world-class” military by 2050. Evidence of China’s intention to continue forward with this plan can be found in China’s 14th Five-Year Plan for 2021-2025. It envisions that China’s military will be fully “mechanized and informationized” by 2027.</p>\n<p>The 2017 speech also provides information about China’s plan on the global level. Xi stated that China would focus on “global combat capabilities” and that China would “move closer to the center of the world.” The President was also optimistic about China’s progression towards the role of global hegemon that it is actively pursuing; he stated that the level of multipolarity in world order was “rapidly accelerating,” implying that he thinks Chinese influence is increasing rapidly.</p>\n<p>To find more concrete signs of increasing Chinese influence in the world, one need not look farther than the principal global organization: The United Nations. Beijing has slowly started taking steps to replace the US from the leadership role in the UN - they have increased funding by more than five times even as the US stopped funding, and the number of Chinese personnel in the UN is also increasing at a significant rate. More than 25% of UN Specialized Agencies are now headed by Chinese nationals. China has also tried to introduce the notion of each country having its own human rights standards, with many labeling this as an attempt to popularize authoritarian rule. The United States would surely find these signs alarming. China is trying to replace and reduce US influence in any and all ways possible. These are further signs that the US might soon find itself in a much less promising position, with the exact opposite being true for China.</p>\n<p>Another example of Chinese strategy is its relations with other countries. China had a considerably tense relationship with North Korea not so long ago, with Beijing being concerned about North Korea’s growing nuclear capabilities. However, in what is another sign of calculated decision-making, China has revitalized its partnership with North Korea in recent times. While China still has concerns about North Korea’s nuclear prowess, it has now accepted this reality and is actively working to increase its influence in Asia in any way possible. China sees the lack of progress in US-North Korea talks as an opportunity to exert its own influence in the region while reducing American influence at the same time. Therefore, the Chinese strategy on the issue of North Korea has far-reaching implications for foreign policy and politics.</p>\n<p>China also abandoned its policy of neutrality in the conflict-ridden Middle-Eastern region in 2016. Realizing that the US has a strained relationship with both Iran and Saudi Arabia and that Russia will continue to remain neutral, China has seen economic opportunities and inserted itself into the conflict between the Middle Eastern countries. The region has a considerable portion of Earth’s conventional oil reserves and China’s manufacturing-focused economy’s need for resources like oil will only continue to rise.</p>\n<p>Finally, China has also sought to increase its influence across a large number of countries in regions like Eurasia, South Asia, Africa, and the Middle-East through its highly controversial Belt and Road Initiative(BRI). This initiative essentially involves China investing large amounts of money to build infrastructure for increased transportation and travel capabilities between these regions. The main motivation behind this initiative lies in finding new markets for Chinese commodities in order to provide a boost to the slowing Chinese economy. BRI is controversial because several Western countries and experts have claimed that the initiative is an attempt to make comparatively smaller economies fall into a debt-trap to gain strategic advantages for China. Once such countries fall into a debt-trap and cannot pay back, they are allegedly pressured by China to support its political and geo-strategic interests. For instance, Tajikistan fell into debt and had to cede about 1158 square kilometers of territory to China; the country still owes $1.2 billion to China. Former Tanzanian President John Magufuli called BRI deals “exploitative,” explaining that Beijing wanted Tanzania to give China guarantees and a 99 years lease on a port construction. Countries at risk of falling into debt trap include Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and many other South Asian nations.</p>\n<p>This is by no means a complete list of strategic Chinese decisions. Other steps taken by China include regional assertion, such as military aggression against India and the continued crackdown on Hong Kong. It is safe to conclude that China is aiming for and beyond the stars its flag also embodies; it is making every effort to have more than one reason to celebrate its hundred-year anniversary in 2049. While not necessarily alarming, China’s progress will certainly result in a wave of implications and consequences across the globe.</p>","fields":{"slug":"15-april-2021-china-a-country-reaching-for-the-stars"},"frontmatter":{"title":"15 April 2021 China: A Country Reaching For The Stars","date":"15.04.2021","category":"Politics","tags":["China","Politics","Development"],"banner":"/assets/bg/politics-bg.jpg"},"timeToRead":5}},"pageContext":{"slug":"15-april-2021-china-a-country-reaching-for-the-stars","prev":{"excerpt":"One of the more intangible concepts that we have to grapple and struggle with in our daily lives is reality.

Oftentimes, we fail to discern what is real and separate it from that which is not; such failure almost always begets dangerous consequences. An incessant belief in or pursuit of unrealistic dreams, goals, or destinations can cause irreparable damage to one’s life. This perilous path is precisely the one down which Jay Gatsby travels in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s eternally relevant novel, The Great Gatsby. Born as Jimmy Gatz, he fashions a new name, personality, and life for himself, with the unfaltering belief that he can make his life what he wants to. His death in the closing stages of the novel — after he has lost everything he had gained — overshadows his achievements and leads readers to assume that his attempt to become Jay Gatsby failed absolutely. Gatsby seems to have become obsessed with a world that was not real. However, a more careful analysis of Gatz and his journey suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p>The novel revolves around Gatz’s aim to transform himself into the titular character, with Fitzgerald giving the reader a valuable perspective on this mission through his writing. Throughout the novel, the author demonstrates Gatz’s eagerness to be recognised as a true aristocrat by describing his various attempts to achieve this aim. After earning a fortune through his illicit partnership with Meyer Wolfshiem, he buys an extravagant mansion in West Egg, starts throwing meretricious parties and building his reputation. He has several shelves full of books, which he has never read, with the sole purpose of giving the impression of an educated man. Gatz repeatedly uses the phrase “old sport”—which was used by wealthy people in England and America during the 1920s—to appear as a person who comes from old money. Similarly, he continuously harps about being an “Oxford man” to further enhance his stature. Both these attempts to be seen as old money come across as unnatural to Jordan and Tom, and are immediately caught by them. In Chapter Three, Jordan expresses her disbelief about Gatz having gone to Oxford, saying, “I just don’t think he went there” (54). In Chapter Seven, Tom contemptuously questions Gatz’s catchphrase when he remarks, “That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?”(135) Through these two events, Fitzgerald portrays just how difficult Gatz’s task is: it is almost impossible to successfully mingle with old money if one has not originally been a part of it.</p>\n<p>Gatz’s ardor for being a part of the upper class is also represented by one of the major themes in the novel: his obsession with Daisy. He sees Daisy as a member of the class he wants to be a part of, and thus sees her as a means to achieve his ultimate goal of becoming “The Great Gatsby”; Fitzgerald demonstrates as much through Gatz’s description of Daisy and his actions related to her. When he first gets to know Daisy, Nick describes his feelings as follows:</p>\n<p>She was the first ‘nice’ girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly desirable . . . It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes. (158-159)</p>\n<p>This description gives valuable insight into what exactly it is that Gatz sees in Daisy. He finds her “excitingly desirable,” and additionally talks about how he had “never been in such a beautiful house before”(158). The mention of “shining motor cars,” and the fact that many men had loved Daisy previously was important to Gatz and “increased her [Daisy’s] value in his eyes,” corroborate the hypothesis that he was attracted more to Daisy’s wealth and status than to Daisy as a person. He perceives Daisy almost like one would do a valuable asset; high demand for it makes the asset seem even more important. Keeping in mind the context of reality and illusion in this analysis, it is worthwhile to note that Gatz makes a conscious choice to be blinded by fantasy during his initial days with Daisy. He acknowledges this in Chapter Eight, as Nick describes: “However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders” (159). Nick also mentions how Gatz had “deliberately given Daisy a sense of security,”(159) even though he knew that this sense of security was false. Five years later, he remains convinced that Daisy is the epitome of the sophisticated class, and being with her is the one way he can achieve his dream. When Nick mentions Daisy’s voice in Chapter Seven, Gatz remarks, “Her voice is full of money” (128). Through this dialogue, Fitzgerald portrays what Daisy and her voice represent to him: the promise of wealth and status. The subsequent description further heightens the concept of Daisy being a highly sought after prize; Nick describes Daisy as “[h]igh in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl” (128). In summary, it is only fair to conclude that Jimmy Gatz was not in love with Daisy, and rather it was the idea of being with Daisy and the value she would bring to his image that he fancied more.</p>\n<p>During the transitory period in Chapter Five when Gatz looked on course to obtain all he wanted, Fitzgerald gives the reader a glimpse of how much he wants to achieve his dream. Nick describes Gatz’s elation regarding his successful reunion with Daisy as having “an inconceivable pitch of intensity” (99). This elation is in complete contrast with the heavy, dejected atmosphere that Fitzgerald builds leading up to and after Gatz’s death. The tragic ending of the novel seems to suggest at face value that Gatz failed miserably in his desperate but unwavering mission of becoming Jay Gatsby. However, when one looks at how far Gatz came and how much he achieved in life, it becomes apparent that he did transform into Jay Gatsby, if only at a fundamental level.</p>\n<p>Fitzgerald also offers hope in Chapter Nine, notably through Gatz’s father. The introduction of his father symbolizes a return to his roots for Gatz, and Fitzgerald uses it to remind the reader that, despite all his faults, he did achieve what he wanted to from a fundamental perspective. His father’s amazement and disbelief at seeing his possessions demonstrate how monumental a task Gatz had done, building up his life from nothing. His father’s reaction says it all: “[When he] saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride” (179). Only a person who came from humble origins, like his father, could comprehend and fully appreciate the effort and dogged attitude it must have taken to come from a poor family in North Dakota and then live in a posh mansion at the heart of the upper class in West Egg, New York. His father remained convinced that, irrespective of his death, Gatz had a “big future in front of him.”(184) Fitzgerald uses this belief to suggest that Jimmy Gatz did become Jay Gatsby in the eyes of his father and, considering that his father is the only character in the novel who comes from the same background as Gatz, this perspective is especially important. It is also worth noting that, regardless of the faults that Nick notices in Gatz over the course of the novel, Nick ultimately becomes his friend, admiring him for his steadfast belief, if nothing else. Through their friendship and Nick’s admiration, Fitzgerald proposes that Nick believed in Jay Gatsby as well.</p>\n<p>In the end, Jimmy Gatz lived as he thought life should be lived: reaching out for his dreams day after day. By describing Gatz’s journey and how far he had come, the author offers an illuminating perspective on the American dream and suggests that Gatz did transform himself into his desired reality of Jay Gatsby, if not in the absolute way he had envisaged. This positive takeaway from the novel is especially relevant in today’s world. There are many young people in America who have the potential as well as the opportunity to make invaluable contributions to society, but they ultimately do not do so because the option is not safe or is out of their comfort zone. Fitzgerald offers the perfect inspiration for such promising individuals by showing that Gatz succeeded in incorporating himself into the impenetrable upper class of the 1920s, even if he was not fully accepted there. Gatz's journey makes the reader realize that there is no light without the dark; accomplishments are great and worth achieving only if there are obstacles that require grit and determination to overcome. As Nick notes at the very end of The Great Gatsby, Gatz believed in “the green light, the orgastic future”(193) that always seems to be just out of reach. Even in the face of death, he is prepared to keep going, his boat against the current; perhaps that is what makes him “The Great Gatsby,” after all.</p>","id":"3172388d-1e20-5652-ab17-f4533409e0bb","fields":{"slug":"26-february-2021-jimmy-gatz-and-jay-gatsby-reality-versus-fantasy-in-the-great-gatsby"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-02-26","title":"26 February 2021: Jimmy Gatz and Jay Gatsby- Reality versus Fantasy in The Great Gatsby","category":"Literature","tags":["Gatsby","Literature"],"banner":"/assets/bg/politics-bg.jpg"},"timeToRead":6},"next":{"excerpt":"Religion is perhaps one of the few aspects of human life which are truly eternal, having existed even before history began to be recorded in writing.

Its very nature is such that it has an extremely unique place in society. It begets positive feelings and brings people from different generations, backgrounds, regions, pasts, together in a way nothing else can. John Steinbeck’s highly-acclaimed The Grapes of Wrath offers a fresh perspective on the nature of religion in its traditional sense and provides Steinbeck’s vision of religion’s ideal role in society and individual lives. In what is a vivid, impactful, and powerful narrative of the Joad family’s journey to California, Steinbeck opines that religion best serves humanity when it has a personal touch to it. He sharply critiques the black and white, right and wrong nature of religion that is traditionally followed while arguing that religion should be based on personal circumstances, not absolute rules.</p>\n<p>Steinbeck introduces this theme of religion through the introduction of the character most associated with it: Jim Casy. Throughout the novel, Steinbeck uses him as a mouthpiece for conveying his religious ideology. A former preacher, Casy struggles to come to terms with his religious identity when he first meets Tom Joad, the protagonist. In one of Casy’s first dialogues, Steinbeck captures the essence of his argument against the traditional form of religion, as Casy says to Tom, “Got a lot of sinful idears—but they seem kinda sensible” (20). Casy feels as he used to have sexual relationships with young girls, often lying with them in the grass. After spending considerable time thinking, he comes to the conclusion that there is no right and wrong; he says to Tom, “There ain’t no sin and there ain’t no virtue. There’s just stuff people do. It’s all part of the same thing. And some of the things folks do is nice, and some ain’t nice, but that’s as far as any man got a right to say” (23). Therefore, Steinbeck argues that no absolute rule should govern the common man’s life without even taking into consideration the circumstances, the past, and the feelings of the individual. The author additionally uses Jim Casy to convey how religion—as it is taught—lacks any real connection. Even preachers like Casy, who are supposed to be the common man’s means to reach God, fail to comprehend this abstract belief. Casy tells Tom that when he asked himself if he loved Jesus, he contemplated for a long time and finally said, “No, I don’t know nobody name’ Jesus. I know a bunch of stories, but I only love people” (23). Thus, Steinbeck labels religion as disconnected from reality and the common man; its conventional form is described as ineffective for society.</p>\n<p>While Jim Casy projects Steinbeck’s opinions on religion, the character of Uncle John is used as one of the main mediums to continue the author’s critique of religion and make the reader realize the negative effects that strict belief in orthodox religion can have on individual lives. Uncle John’s life has been derailed by feelings of guilt, as his wife died from appendicitis when he neglected her care. Since then, he tries to repent for his sin by continuously trying to help others. Steinbeck paints a desolate and listless picture of Uncle John’s life. He tries to live a life of sanctity, not eat any luxurious food and avoid drinking. However, he ultimately gives in to his temptations, as his “appetites swelled into pressures until they broke through” (96). He then eats, drinks, and satisfies his sexual desires until he reaches his physical limit; thereafter, he reverts to his pious life marred by shame and penitence, trying to help people and being kind by giving candies to children, and cutting wood for free. Steinbeck writes that John’s feelings had “left an unbreaking loneliness on him” (96). Therefore, Steinbeck uses this character as an example of the harm conventional religion can cause; John is constantly wracked by guilt because he feels he sinned, and his forced attempts to live a celibate life consign him to worsening physical and mental health. When Jim Casy heroically sacrifices himself to save Tom after an altercation with a police officer, Uncle John is overwhelmed with abasement, as seeing this selfless act makes him question his own morality. He goes and gets drunk to cope with the guilt, singing to Jesus: “I’ve give my heart to Jesus, so Jesus take me home. I’ve give my soul to Jesus, so Jesus is my home” (275). This dialogue further corroborates the hypothesis that Uncle John’s feelings of guilt were born of his belief in virtues, sins, and salvation. He sings, pleads, and surrenders himself to Jesus to gain forgiveness and salvation. Steinbeck uses this moment of Uncle John’s vulnerability to emphasize that he has been reduced to this shadow of a man purely because of the guilt he feels, and, more importantly, the guilt he thinks he should feel.</p>\n<p>While Uncle John might be the most prominent example of a character negatively affected by religion in The Grapes of Wrath, he is by no means the only one. Steinbeck uses the character of Mrs. Sandry, a woman that the Joads come across at a government camp in California, to portray how religion can also consume a person and make them prey on others. Mrs. Sandry has turned into a religious zealot due to her obsession with virtues and sins. When Rose of Sharon is sitting alone, Mrs. Sandry sees an opportunity to warn the innocent young girl about committing any religious transgressions. She says to the pregnant Rose, “You be good. If you got sin on you—you better watch out for that there baby” (308). She complains about the sinners in the government camp who act in plays and take part in hug dancing, saying that “[t]hey ain’t but a few deep down Jesus-lovers lef[t]” (309). Thus, Steinbeck emphasizes how Mrs. Sandry solely focuses on finding and condemning people who commit sins while taking little part in social activities herself. The author makes the reader realize that this traditional form of religion can often be divisive, labeling those who partake in certain acts as sinners, with the added effect of society condemning and distancing itself from such people.</p>\n<p>Alongside this critique, the author presents his vision of the ideal religion. Through Jim Casy and Tom Joad, Steinbeck describes how—with a shift in focus towards people— the same religion that divides us, can unite us as well. Using Casy and Tom’s religious awakenings, he emphasizes that real joy comes from human connections. Jim Casy, and later Tom, decide to act upon this newfound realization and dedicate their lives to the migrant cause, working for the collective good. Both these characters are also used to project the Oversoul theory, as both Casy and Tom talk about all humans being part of one big soul; Steinbeck uses this description to further highlight the power of human interconnectedness. He finishes his discourse on religion through Tom’s last conversation with his mother, which praises the power of human connection one final time, as Tom quotes Scripture: “[I]f two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him, and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken” (418). Using concrete physical examples of people conserving heat by being close and the strength of a three-fold cord, Steinbeck successfully makes the reader visualize the strength that human connection can have, if only it is used to its best advantage.</p>\n<p>Steinbeck thus uses the sharp contrast between Jim Casy’s religion and the conventional form to comprehensively convince the reader of the former’s benefits.  Above all, he leaves one with a better understanding of the immense power of human connection and unity. In a time where we are getting disconnected even from the people closest to us, the lessons we learn from this novel are invaluable. Every single person needs social interaction, and the digital age brings with its promise of an advanced life the promise of decreasing human connection. Loneliness and depression are becoming major problems that society is struggling to tackle. What is more troubling is that these two issues can create several other problems like terrorism and domestic violence, which can cause much more direct harm. Therefore, it is increasingly important for us to reconnect with each other; unity and cooperation are a must if we are to solve these problems and the countless others plaguing humanity in the 21st century. As Tom says to his mother when bidding goodbye, each of us is a “little piece of a great big soul” (418), and only when this little piece unites with the rest, does it become whole.</p>","id":"53954e4d-873c-5f9d-bb40-8d4fc3379a85","fields":{"slug":"30-april-2021-steinbecks-portrayal-of-religion-in-the-grapes-of-wrath"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-04-30","title":"30 April 2021: Steinbeck’s Portrayal of Religion in The Grapes of Wrath","category":"Literature","tags":["Steinbeck","Literature"],"banner":"/assets/bg/politics-bg.jpg"},"timeToRead":6}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3824141623"]}
