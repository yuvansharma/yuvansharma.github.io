It is not solely a foreign policy matter; rather, it consists of both domestic and foreign aspects which are intertwined to create an extremely complicated, intricate issue which the U.S. has been struggling to end for decades.</p>\n<p>Current U.S. policy is lacking in several areas, including legal pathways to immigration, amnesty for illegal immigrants, and addressing the short-term and long-term push factors in Central America that force immigrants to look to the United States for opportunities.  The American approach to immigration is ambiguous, confusing, and has no immediate or long-term fix for immigration.</p>\n<p>U.S. policy must be modified to make skills-based immigration the major category for legal immigration, and it must also coordinate with Mexico and Latin America to stop illegal immigrants and solve the root causes of the immigration issue, as immigration can become a great strength for the United States if it is handled properly. These changes are essential as they would provide the U.S. with economic benefits while solving the immigration conundrum at both the immediate and long-term levels, and addressing the long-term problems is critical to ending the crisis in the future.</p>\n<h2 id=\"background\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#background\" aria-label=\"background permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Background</h2>\n<p>An appropriate place to begin an analysis of the immigration issue is Central America and consider the reasons why people migrate from there to the United States in the first place. The three countries in Central America from which most immigrants originate are Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, together known as the Northern Triangle. There are several long-term as well as short-term push factors which compel these immigrants to make the difficult journey across Mexico. Socioeconomic conditions are bad and have shown no signs of improvement in the last few decades, as land ownership and economic influence “remain concentrated in the hands of a small group of elites” (Congressional Research Service, 2021). As the working population of these countries continues to increase in size, immigration numbers are creeping up. The newer generations look for opportunities in the United States because job creation in their own countries continues to lag. Besides economic woes, violence is another long-term push factor in the Northern Triangle. Homicide rates have risen sharply since the start of the 21st century because the region has become the main pathway for drug smugglers into the United States. Consequently, the region is plagued with violence as gangs battle for control of local drug distribution and supremacy (Congressional Research Service, 2021). The violent altercations have displaced a large number of people, who eventually decide to leave their country when they have no way back to their homes.</p>\n<p>A major short-term factor is natural disasters. The region has been struggling with annual droughts which have consequently impacted crops and farmer income. Honduras was hit by two destructive hurricanes, Eta and Iota, in quick succession in November 2020. The government’s ineffective and insufficient response to these hurricanes and the other long-term issues afflicting their countries also convinced many people to migrate and has played a major role in the recent immigration waves. (Congressional Research Service, 2021)</p>\n<p>The U.S. policy on immigration also plays an important role. Before 1965, immigration to the U.S. was based on national quotas, to limit the number of people that could enter from each country. In 1965, this policy was changed to one based on uniting immigrant families in the U.S. and attracting skilled workers. This led to a shift in the major source of immigration, from Northwestern Europe to Asia and Latin America. Since then, immigration numbers have risen from around 320,000 immigrants per year in the 1960s to more than 1 million per year by 2000 (Center for Immigration Studies).</p>\n<h2 id=\"current-us-policy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#current-us-policy\" aria-label=\"current us policy permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Current U.S. Policy</h2>\n<p>The majority of immigrants who legally enter the United States currently do so through family-based immigration, wherein the prospective migrant has a family member already living in the United States with citizenship, and in some cases, a green card. This family member sponsors the migrant, who is allowed into the U.S. after his application is reviewed and approved. A small number of immigrants also enter the countries through other pathways. One is refugee admissions, a process through which the U.S. allows refugees who are escaping persecution in their home countries. The United States places an upper limit on the number of refugees that can be admitted. For fiscal 2021, Former President Trump had placed this limit at 15,000, and President Biden has proposed raising this number to 62,500 (Pew Research Center, 2021). Another method for entry into the U.S. is employment-based green cards, which are awarded to foreign workers. Diversity visas, intended to diversify the population and awarded on a lottery basis, and H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, are the other primary legal pathways into the United States (Pew Research Center, 2021). For immigrants from Central America who might not be skilled workers and cannot apply for family-based immigration but still want to legally enter the US, the system is extremely ambiguous and confusing, to the point of being incoherent. This is because U.S. policies on immigration are not based on a single legislation; rather, they are the result of an iterative process of immigration legislation over many years, and as a result, they have become complicated and confusing over time. The legal pathways are very tightly constrained and in some cases, being skilled, knowing English, and having studied at a U.S. university might be considered less important than marrying a U.S. citizen. The arbitrariness of the immigration system has thus led a lot of immigrants to seek illegal entry into the United States (Hoover Institution et al., 2021).</p>\n<p>For immigrants who have already entered the United States, the asylum system is also ambiguous. A migrant seeking asylum goes through formal processes, but the system’s machinery often gets overwhelmed by demand and as a result, several immigrants do not get the chance to hear the verdict on their asylum appeal. Illegal immigrants have no clear path to amnesty; the U.S. government occasionally provides amnesties to very specific groups of people, but there is still a huge number of illegal immigrants who have no clear legal status (Hoover Institution et al., 2021).</p>\n<h2 id=\"analysis\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#analysis\" aria-label=\"analysis permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Analysis</h2>\n<p>Immigration is a complex issue, and the view that it is a burden for the U.S. to deal with is uninformed. It is critical to realize that immigration is actually a great strength for the U.S. on the global stage, and, if used in the best manner, can give the U.S. an advantage over its competitors. The immigrant demographic does not just consist of industrial workers, farmers, or laborers. There are all kinds of people among the immigrants, including skilled workers and professionals. This is mainly because the immigrants leave their country due to universal issues like drug violence, corruption, and ill-governance, rather than an issue that affects only one particular section of the Central American population. Therefore, immigrants also include skilled workers which the U.S. workforce can greatly benefit from. An important point to note here is that immigrants can easily become a natural part of the US, as it inherently has people from a large number of backgrounds and cultures. As a result, immigrants will not feel like foreigners, and within one to two generations, their families will integrate into American society. In this regard, the United States has an advantage over regions like Europe or Japan, which have faced issues in immigration and increasing the presence of foreign professionals as these regions have a single, dominant, cultural background (George W. Bush Institute &#x26; Rice, 2021). By attracting skilled workers from the countries in Central America, the U.S. can benefit economically while also giving immigrants an opportunity for a better life. An important example to note is Fiji, a country which non-native South Asians became eager to leave after a major coup. The instability led to these South Asians searching for alternative places to reside in, and as a result, they began to strategically improve their education and skills to climb the ladder on the skill-based immigration policies of countries like Australia and New Zealand. Until then, natives and non-native South Asians had had the same education levels; however, after the coup, the South Asians began to gain skills to successfully immigrate. Therefore, skills-based immigration benefits both the country receiving immigrants and the immigrants themselves (Hoover Institution et al., 2021).</p>\n<p>Current U.S. policy does not address different groups of immigrants in an efficient manner, which results in confusion, ambiguity, and a lack of control over the system. The United States should address the immigrant issue by dividing the immigrants into three distinct groups: the illegal immigrants already present in the US, the immigrants waiting at the border and those about to cross into the US, and those who have not yet started the journey to the U.S. but may become potential immigrants in the future. Solving the issue for the first two groups requires a short-term solution while solving the issue for the third group is more of a long-term solution focusing on the root causes and push factors persisting in Central America. The short-term solution needs to include amnesty for the illegal immigrants present in the U.S. and also involve cooperation with Mexico to use it as a buffer region to contain and stop most of the illegal immigrants. The long-term solution involves cooperation with the Central American countries to help them solve the issues there. This is exactly what is lacking in current and previous U.S. policy; it does not cooperate with Mexico to a sufficient degree, and also does not focus on helping the Northern Triangle countries. As a result, both the short-term and long-term problems continue to trouble the United States.</p>\n<p>Current U.S. policy on legal immigration is also unsatisfactory. The primary pathway is through family sponsorship. A major problem with family sponsorship is the sheer volume of applications that the U.S. receives. A large number of applicants often have to wait for years to receive a green card because of a per-country quota which restricts the number of green cards that a particular country’s citizens receive to no more than 7% of the total green cards issued (Pew Research Center, 2021). Another issue is the potential entry of individuals who are unable to financially support themselves, which places a burden on American resources while offering little to the U.S. in return. In addition, restricting the main category of immigration to family-based immigration is a major problem, as the preexisting presence of an individual who will harm rather than contribute to society can lead to the entry of more such individuals.\nLastly, the United States’ approach to amnesty is haphazard; some illegal immigrants receive amnesty while others do not, and this process is arbitrary. In addition, a large number of immigrants neither receive amnesty nor get deported, leaving them without any legal rights, a status contradictory to the democratic nature of the U.S. The main argument against amnesty for all immigrants is that it essentially incentivizes illegal immigration, but the best solution for this problem is providing amnesty for current illegal immigrants and using resolute enforcement in the future, by coordinating with the Latin American countries and Mexico as described earlier. The only way to deal with illegal immigration is to improve border enforcement and cooperation with Mexican authorities to ensure that most illegal immigrants are stopped in Mexico before they can reach the border.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opinion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#opinion\" aria-label=\"opinion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Opinion</h2>\n<p>Current U.S. policy on immigration is unsatisfactory in several departments, including the legal path into the United States, amnesty for illegal immigrants present in the U.S., and in terms of addressing the short-term and long-term push factors to stop large-scale immigration in the future. The Biden administration has undoubtedly taken some much-needed decisions on immigration in the past few months to reduce the negative impact that the Trump administration had; however, there are still several ways to improve the current U.S. policies while keeping the United States’ benefit in mind.</p>\n<p>As far as the legal path into the United States is concerned, family-based immigration should predominantly be replaced by skill-based immigration. This change will give the U.S. assured economic benefit as it admits people by giving skilled professionals higher priority, and it gives these professionals an ideal atmosphere to best utilize their skills as well. It is important to note that an ideal policy would not remove family-based immigration entirely; it would still be important to continue family-based immigration in terms of reuniting families who are separated. However, family-based immigration would be given less priority. In addition, family-based immigration would include prioritization based on immigrants’ skills to allow them to climb up the ladder. This further ensures economic return for the United States and does not place a burden on its resources. Skill-based immigration is especially important and beneficial if the United States continues to place a limit on immigration, as it has been doing. Another major benefit of skill-based immigration and family-based immigration running simultaneously is it would get bipartisan support; Republicans are likely to support skill-based immigration because of its economic benefits while Democrats will want to continue family-based immigration for reunification purposes, making it easier for Congress to pass legislation on immigration.</p>\n<p>Amnesty for illegal immigrants already present in the U.S. is also an important part of U.S. policy that should be improved. Such illegal immigrants should be fined and then given amnesty as long as they have not committed any serious crimes, in which case there should be further investigation and deportation if necessary. To avoid amnesty becoming an incentive for illegal immigration, the United States must ensure resolute enforcement in the future, both domestically and in Mexico and Latin America. Enforcement in Mexico and Latin America falls under addressing the short-term and long-term factors of Central American immigration. Enforcement, systemic reform, and amnesty must follow a particular order to ensure the maximum positive impact. Firstly, the system should be reformed around skills-based immigration as described above. Then, the illegal immigrants present in the United States should be given amnesty, which should be followed by resolute border enforcement in collaboration with Mexico.</p>\n<p>Addressing the short-term and long-term immigration factors requires efficient coordination with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries. The United States must negotiate with Mexico to make sure that it stops and contains most of the illegal immigrants that come. This strategy uses Mexico as a buffer region, which minimizes the migrant flow that the U.S. has to deal with. The U.S. must also help Mexico establish holding facilities in Mexico for individuals who wish to seek asylum lawfully. Creating similar facilities in the United States will ensure the U.S. can comfortably deal with these immigrants. They will be transferred from the Mexican facilities to the American facilities as each immigrant is dealt with and either allowed entry or deported if it is necessary (CBS, 2021). The United States should additionally negotiate with Mexico to ensure that Mexico strictly regulates its southern border and detains any person or groups which intend to cross into the U.S. illegally. Lastly, the United States must hold dialogue with the Northern Triangle countries to decide the best method to solve their longstanding issues, through direct intervention, aid, or some other method. If these countries resist change due to systemic corruption, the U.S. must directly intervene to remove the drug cartels and corruption and once again establish peace in the region, preferably with the United Nations’ support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bibliography\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#bibliography\" aria-label=\"bibliography permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Bibliography</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CBS (Director).

Its very nature is such that it has an extremely unique place in society. It begets positive feelings and brings people from different generations, backgrounds, regions, pasts, together in a way nothing else can. John Steinbeck’s highly-acclaimed The Grapes of Wrath offers a fresh perspective on the nature of religion in its traditional sense and provides Steinbeck’s vision of religion’s ideal role in society and individual lives. In what is a vivid, impactful, and powerful narrative of the Joad family’s journey to California, Steinbeck opines that religion best serves humanity when it has a personal touch to it. He sharply critiques the black and white, right and wrong nature of religion that is traditionally followed while arguing that religion should be based on personal circumstances, not absolute rules.</p>\n<p>Steinbeck introduces this theme of religion through the introduction of the character most associated with it: Jim Casy. Throughout the novel, Steinbeck uses him as a mouthpiece for conveying his religious ideology. A former preacher, Casy struggles to come to terms with his religious identity when he first meets Tom Joad, the protagonist. In one of Casy’s first dialogues, Steinbeck captures the essence of his argument against the traditional form of religion, as Casy says to Tom, “Got a lot of sinful idears—but they seem kinda sensible” (20). Casy feels as he used to have sexual relationships with young girls, often lying with them in the grass. After spending considerable time thinking, he comes to the conclusion that there is no right and wrong; he says to Tom, “There ain’t no sin and there ain’t no virtue. There’s just stuff people do. It’s all part of the same thing. And some of the things folks do is nice, and some ain’t nice, but that’s as far as any man got a right to say” (23). Therefore, Steinbeck argues that no absolute rule should govern the common man’s life without even taking into consideration the circumstances, the past, and the feelings of the individual. The author additionally uses Jim Casy to convey how religion—as it is taught—lacks any real connection. Even preachers like Casy, who are supposed to be the common man’s means to reach God, fail to comprehend this abstract belief. Casy tells Tom that when he asked himself if he loved Jesus, he contemplated for a long time and finally said, “No, I don’t know nobody name’ Jesus. I know a bunch of stories, but I only love people” (23). Thus, Steinbeck labels religion as disconnected from reality and the common man; its conventional form is described as ineffective for society.</p>\n<p>While Jim Casy projects Steinbeck’s opinions on religion, the character of Uncle John is used as one of the main mediums to continue the author’s critique of religion and make the reader realize the negative effects that strict belief in orthodox religion can have on individual lives. Uncle John’s life has been derailed by feelings of guilt, as his wife died from appendicitis when he neglected her care. Since then, he tries to repent for his sin by continuously trying to help others. Steinbeck paints a desolate and listless picture of Uncle John’s life. He tries to live a life of sanctity, not eat any luxurious food and avoid drinking. However, he ultimately gives in to his temptations, as his “appetites swelled into pressures until they broke through” (96). He then eats, drinks, and satisfies his sexual desires until he reaches his physical limit; thereafter, he reverts to his pious life marred by shame and penitence, trying to help people and being kind by giving candies to children, and cutting wood for free. Steinbeck writes that John’s feelings had “left an unbreaking loneliness on him” (96). Therefore, Steinbeck uses this character as an example of the harm conventional religion can cause; John is constantly wracked by guilt because he feels he sinned, and his forced attempts to live a celibate life consign him to worsening physical and mental health. When Jim Casy heroically sacrifices himself to save Tom after an altercation with a police officer, Uncle John is overwhelmed with abasement, as seeing this selfless act makes him question his own morality. He goes and gets drunk to cope with the guilt, singing to Jesus: “I’ve give my heart to Jesus, so Jesus take me home. I’ve give my soul to Jesus, so Jesus is my home” (275). This dialogue further corroborates the hypothesis that Uncle John’s feelings of guilt were born of his belief in virtues, sins, and salvation. He sings, pleads, and surrenders himself to Jesus to gain forgiveness and salvation. Steinbeck uses this moment of Uncle John’s vulnerability to emphasize that he has been reduced to this shadow of a man purely because of the guilt he feels, and, more importantly, the guilt he thinks he should feel.</p>\n<p>While Uncle John might be the most prominent example of a character negatively affected by religion in The Grapes of Wrath, he is by no means the only one. Steinbeck uses the character of Mrs. Sandry, a woman that the Joads come across at a government camp in California, to portray how religion can also consume a person and make them prey on others. Mrs. Sandry has turned into a religious zealot due to her obsession with virtues and sins. When Rose of Sharon is sitting alone, Mrs. Sandry sees an opportunity to warn the innocent young girl about committing any religious transgressions. She says to the pregnant Rose, “You be good. If you got sin on you—you better watch out for that there baby” (308). She complains about the sinners in the government camp who act in plays and take part in hug dancing, saying that “[t]hey ain’t but a few deep down Jesus-lovers lef[t]” (309). Thus, Steinbeck emphasizes how Mrs. Sandry solely focuses on finding and condemning people who commit sins while taking little part in social activities herself. The author makes the reader realize that this traditional form of religion can often be divisive, labeling those who partake in certain acts as sinners, with the added effect of society condemning and distancing itself from such people.</p>\n<p>Alongside this critique, the author presents his vision of the ideal religion. Through Jim Casy and Tom Joad, Steinbeck describes how—with a shift in focus towards people— the same religion that divides us, can unite us as well. Using Casy and Tom’s religious awakenings, he emphasizes that real joy comes from human connections. Jim Casy, and later Tom, decide to act upon this newfound realization and dedicate their lives to the migrant cause, working for the collective good. Both these characters are also used to project the Oversoul theory, as both Casy and Tom talk about all humans being part of one big soul; Steinbeck uses this description to further highlight the power of human interconnectedness. He finishes his discourse on religion through Tom’s last conversation with his mother, which praises the power of human connection one final time, as Tom quotes Scripture: “[I]f two lie together, then they have heat: but how can one be warm alone? And if one prevail against him, two shall withstand him, and a three-fold cord is not quickly broken” (418). Using concrete physical examples of people conserving heat by being close and the strength of a three-fold cord, Steinbeck successfully makes the reader visualize the strength that human connection can have, if only it is used to its best advantage.</p>\n<p>Steinbeck thus uses the sharp contrast between Jim Casy’s religion and the conventional form to comprehensively convince the reader of the former’s benefits.  Above all, he leaves one with a better understanding of the immense power of human connection and unity. In a time where we are getting disconnected even from the people closest to us, the lessons we learn from this novel are invaluable. Every single person needs social interaction, and the digital age brings with its promise of an advanced life the promise of decreasing human connection. Loneliness and depression are becoming major problems that society is struggling to tackle. What is more troubling is that these two issues can create several other problems like terrorism and domestic violence, which can cause much more direct harm. Therefore, it is increasingly important for us to reconnect with each other; unity and cooperation are a must if we are to solve these problems and the countless others plaguing humanity in the 21st century. As Tom says to his mother when bidding goodbye, each of us is a “little piece of a great big soul” (418), and only when this little piece unites with the rest, does it become whole.</p>","id":"53954e4d-873c-5f9d-bb40-8d4fc3379a85","fields":{"slug":"30-april-2021-steinbecks-portrayal-of-religion-in-the-grapes-of-wrath"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-04-30","title":"30 April 2021: Steinbeck’s Portrayal of Religion in The Grapes of Wrath","category":"Literature","tags":["Steinbeck","Literature"],"banner":"/assets/bg/politics-bg.jpg"},"timeToRead":6},"next":{"excerpt":"Origin of Racism and Slavery The origin of systemic racism against African-Americans in the United States has numerous potential explanations.

Generally speaking, racism stemmed from different religions and the globally accepted norm of owning slaves who were of a different faith. In the United States specifically, it is thought that the white landowners wanted to have an advantage over African-Americans in terms of resources, and these acts of self-interest slowly started to be justified by the development of racist ideas. Therefore, the mistreatment that black people faced during the slavery era and beyond that did not start from pre-existing racist ideas. Rather, the white landowners needed justification for enslaving blacks and this need for justification led to racist ideas and centuries of anguish for African Americans.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-trans-atlantic-slave-trade\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-trans-atlantic-slave-trade\" aria-label=\"the trans atlantic slave trade permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade</h2>\n<p>Africans were brought into North America through the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, which was the systematic import of African men and women into the Caribbean, South America, and later North America to work as slaves. The largely agricultural nature of the region was the chief factor that drove the demand for slaves, as they provided cheap labor for the huge agricultural fields that were extremely profitable to the rich landowners. It is important to note that Americans were never the leaders in the Trans-Atlantic slave trade, which lasted from the 16th century to the 19th century. Rather, the slave trade to North America was only a fraction of the entire picture. The Portuguese and the Spanish settlers in the Americas were the ones who drove the majority of the slave trade. About 10 million Africans reached the Americas from Africa throughout the slavery era, but only about 388,000 of them reached North America. Instead, most of them were taken to Spanish territories in Central America, or the British and Dutch areas in the Caribbean, and the Portuguese territories in Brazil, which received about 4.8 million slaves. Initially, Portugal and Spain dominated the slave trade. Slowly, the British and Dutch slave trade increased, and the United States also joined in. The most troubling aspect of the Trans-Atlantic slave trade wasn’t the slavery that came after it. In fact, it was the journey from Africa to the Americas. The Africans were kidnapped, forcibly taken from their homes, or even bought from African kings in exchange for European goods and put onto ships with others like them. They were crowded below deck in pathetic conditions, resulting in a huge number of them dying due to hunger, thirst, and disease.</p>\n<p>In addition to the inhumanity of slave trade, it had another disastrous side effect. Slave trade involved taking away the ablest section of Africa’s working population, young men, women, and children. This resulted in a long-term decline in population as well as economic productivity, though some experts argue this damage was largely limited due to the profit that African kings received from the slave trade. The United States abolished the import of slaves into its territory in 1808, but some illegal slave trade still continued till the late 1850s. Slave trade to the Americas ended totally in the 19th century as different regions gradually abolished it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-slavery-era-southern-secession-and-the-civil-war\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-slavery-era-southern-secession-and-the-civil-war\" aria-label=\"the slavery era southern secession and the civil war permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Slavery Era, Southern Secession, and the Civil War</h2>\n<p>The Africans who did survive the journey to the United States lived a life full of cruelty, punishment, and hatred on part of their white masters. As explained before, slavery eventually led to the establishment of racist ideologies, and as a result, slaves had to deal with mistreatment on a daily basis. They had to work in the fields all day and were not given proper food, water, or shelter. They would be abused, flogged, and lynched for small wrongs, and female slaves would often be raped by their masters. Slaves were treated as animals, not as humans, and any slave who could read and write would be severely punished. The belief was that black people were not deserving of an education, and their place was below their white masters. Slaves were mainly in demand in the South, as the southern states were largely agriculture-dependent as opposed to the northern states which had been industrialized. As a result, the southern states were in support of slavery and it was legal in these states, but it was banned in some northern states.\nThe information that we have today of slave life is through slave narratives, the narrations of slaves who ran away from their masters and succeeded in chronicling their stories. A noteworthy example is Solomon Northup, who was a free black man living as a violinist in New York when he was kidnapped and made to work as a slave for 12 years in Louisiana before he eventually managed to be freed. Northup wrote about his experience in detail in his memoir 12 Years a Slave. He wrote about how he would often be beaten up or flogged, and how another female slave, Patsey, who became his friend, would often be raped by their indifferent master. Northup’s candid memoir also showed how not all white masters were oblivious to the racist nature of slavery, as he writes about a previous master of his too, who was kind, treated him with respect, and even gave him a violin to play.</p>\n<p>In 1860, when Abraham Lincoln won the election, seven Southern slave states seceded from the United States and formed the Confederacy. The main reason for the southern secession was the issue of slavery, as Abraham Lincoln was against it and wanted it to be abolished in any new territories America occupied. This secession led to the American Civil War, where the Union fought against the Confederacy of the southern states to try and reunite all the states of the country. The war began in 1861 and ended in 1865 with the defeat of the Confederacy. All the states once again became part of the Union. In 1865, the Thirteenth Amendment was passed, which abolished slavery, except as a “punishment for crime,” a clause that has far-reaching impacts today in the criminal justice system and the “prison industry”.</p>\n<h2 id=\"social-reconstruction\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#social-reconstruction\" aria-label=\"social reconstruction permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Social Reconstruction</h2>\n<p>Social Reconstruction was the phase from 1865-1877 when the federal government made several changes to policy to address the inequality that had existed before the abolition of slavery. Reconstruction was made necessary by the newfound freedom of about 4 million black people who had previously been enslaved. As a result of this freedom, there were several economic, political and social changes that had to be made to integrate these ex-slaves into American society. As part of these changes, the 13th, 14th, and 15th amendments were adopted, often known as the reconstruction amendments. The 13th amendment abolished slavery except for criminals, the 14th amendment secured citizenship rights for slaves and minority groups and the 15th amendment secured voting rights and prohibited discrimination in voting rights on the basis of race, color or previous status of servitude. Jobs and homes were created for ex-slaves through the introduction of sharecropping, which allowed landowners to rent land to them. However, sharecropping was often misused by landowners and black people were often unofficially used as slaves. After President Lincoln was assassinated, Andrew Johnson became President. He was a Southerner and had a much more lenient stance to those who had formed the Confederacy. He addressed the problem of integrating the South back into the Union by allowing them to jon on terms favorable to them. The South was divided into five different military districts which were placed under Union generals. In 1877, after a closely contested election which yielded no clear winner, the Democrats and the Republicans made a deal known as the Bargain of 1877. The Republican candidate, Rutherford B. Hayes, would be made President in exchange for the removal of Union generals from the South. This deal effectively ended Reconstruction and ushered in the era of Jim Crow laws and racial segregation, which would only end in the 1960s with the civil rights movement.</p>","id":"1de1a637-8cf6-58d0-93de-33ce6c9689f8","fields":{"slug":"27-june-2021-a-history-of-slavery-in-the-united-states"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-06-27","title":"27 June 2021: A History of Slavery in the United States","category":"History","tags":["Slavery","Civil War","African-American"],"banner":"/assets/bg/politics-bg.jpg"},"timeToRead":5}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3824141623"]}
