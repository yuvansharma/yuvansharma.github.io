The Jeff Bezos-led company has a publishing arm, a television studio and has started challenging Netflix in the streaming service domain. Amazon additionally produces consumer electronics like the Kindle, Amazon Echo, Fire tablets and Fire TV.</p>\n<p>Microsoft is one of the two big names in console gaming, occupies a substantial share of the desktop software market through Windows and also has the second-largest cloud computing market share through Microsoft Azure.</p>\n<p>Facebook is the dominant company when it comes to social networking, online media sharing through Instagram and YouTube. It is a significant presence in instant messaging, with WhatsApp becoming more popular day by day.</p>\n<p>Apple and Google share the entire market for mobile operating systems between themselves. Google has 72% of the market through Android, Apple has the remaining 27%. Google bought Android in 2005 to get into the mobile OS business, and it has since beaten established competitors like BlackBerry and even Microsoft’s Windows Phone. Google is also the undisputed leader in online search engines.</p>\n<p>Reading this might have made one realise just how prevalent these companies have become in our consumer lives without us catching on. Perhaps unfortunately, this is just the tip of the iceberg. The list goes on and on. How exactly have these companies succeeded in whichever market they venture into? According to a growing number of experts as well as some members of the US Congress, the path these industry giants took to reach this unparalleled success might well have been one of depravity.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n* * * *\n</p>\nThe word Big Tech is being thrown around a lot these days, and while most people are fairly familiar with the terminology by now, we’ll revisit it once more merely for the sake of starting this pivotal and extremely important story from the right place.\n<p>Big Tech refers to the five companies which dominate nearly every field of technology and share practically the entire market among themselves: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. Each of these companies has established themselves as the unrivalled leader in their respective industries, and each of them is also actively building towards a future where they have no serious challenge from any prospective or ambitious competitor. The problem with this vision isn’t the vision itself: monopolies are actually allowed under current US law. The part which is stirring up controversy and attracting unwanted attention is the method which these companies are using to achieve this vision. Are they really going too far to snuff out competition? Are they using their current dominance in their industry to ensure a future where there is no one left to dominate?</p>\n<p>These are some of the questions which are being asked increasingly frequently, and arriving at the answers is easier said than done. A substantial portion of the solution depends on how antitrust laws are interpreted, and to what extent research - on markets, rivals and their products - can be deemed as part of normal tactics and not of anti-competitive ones.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n* * * *\n</p>\nIn 1998, Microsoft was sued by the US government for using anti-competitive practices to eradicate competition. The lawsuit stated that Microsoft was wrongly using its dominance in the market to create a monopoly and remove any threats to its position. It alleged that Microsoft had intentionally made it difficult to install and use rival software on Windows computers and laptops.\n<p>Antitrust laws ensure one company doesn’t control or take over the market and doesn’t inflate prices accordingly. Microsoft had bundled additional programs into Windows software which was a loss for rival companies, and this was the crux of the argument against Microsoft. For example, when it started to give its browser software - Internet Explorer - for free, its top competitor Netscape failed to sustain itself and collapsed.</p>\n<p>While the lawsuit remained controversial with many saying there wasn’t any case against Microsoft at all, the presiding judge ruled that the antitrust charges were indeed true and that Microsoft had created a monopoly in the industry that threatened competition as well as innovation. The company was asked to break up into two entities, one with the operating software and the other constituting the software arm.</p>\n<p>However, Microsoft appealed against the ruling and consequently, the appeals court overturned the original decision. The Department of Justice made an agreement with Microsoft which asked the company to share its computing interfaces with other companies in the industry instead of breaking up.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n* * * *\n</p>\nThe Big Tech companies (except Microsoft as of now) are facing exactly what Bill Gates’ company faced in 1998, except that there is much more data that can be used against them this time. It is worth noting, however, that the digital landscape has also changed at a rapid rate and it can be reasonably argued that current laws don’t monitor and regulate anti-competitive practices as they should be doing.\n<p>After investigating the Big Tech companies for 16 months, a report led by US House lawmakers concluded in October 2020 that all of them (excluding Microsoft) had used their dominance in their industry to remove competition. Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are all accused of controlling prices and distributing goods and services in a biased manner. The committee report claims that these companies reduce the business for third party competitors - like sellers on Amazon or app developers on Android and iOS - thus trying to end any serious competition to their own business. The report’s claims include but are not limited to the following:</p>\n<p>Amazon uses seller data to understand which products sell better and which ones Amazon should itself start to produce and sell.  37% of sellers on Amazon rely on the company as their only source of income, binding them to Amazon and forcing them to put up with tactics like these which Amazon uses to promote its own products while reducing business for these sellers.</p>\n<p>Apple (mis)uses its ownership of the App Store to obtain “completely sensitive information” about third-party apps. This helps them to understand which kind of services are in demand. Apple then integrates these into its own services.</p>\n<p>Facebook used user data from its private networking app Onavo. The company then used this data to identify WhatsApp as a hugely popular alternative, and a competitor. Facebook consequently acquired WhatsApp in 2014.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the report says that Google used search and Gmail statistics to understand what kind of web browsers are more popular. This gave them a significant advantage when they launched Google Chrome. Since then, Chrome has become the most popular browser option by quite some distance. Google allegedly increases the degree of this monopoly using information from third-party sites like Yelp to improve its search results. Chrome now sends its own user data to Google, allowing Google to now use browser data to understand the demand for other services better. This potentially allows them to dominate in whichever industry or domain they want.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n* * * *\n</p>\nAll four companies have completely rejected the findings of the committee. Amazon said that these “uninformed notions” could instead harm small businesses and sellers using the e-commerce company as a platform. Apple “vehemently” disagreed with the report. Facebook said that its mergers with Instagram and WhatsApp weren’t anti-competitive in any way. The company also added that its acquisition of WhatsApp was cleared by the government earlier and so it saw no reason for another investigation into the same matter.\n<p>The Democrats present in the Congress recommended reforming antitrust laws, substantial restructuring for these big companies and making it illegal for them to preferentially show their own products (like Google shows its products first in search results). However, a large number of Republicans refused to consider any of these reforms, especially those involving restructuring the companies and their business models; suggesting that Congress is divided over this controversial issue and that there might be several obstacles to overcome on the road to reforming the laws concerned.</p>\n<p>The five Big Tech companies have created a world where it is practically impossible to live without being surrounded and even overwhelmed by their products and services. They have created near-perfect market intelligence such that there is no practical way for a competitor to even challenge them for a prolonged period of time. The concerned laws seem outdated in any case; several experts have stated that they do not appropriately address several areas due to the rapid advancement and change in the digital world. It remains to be seen whether this leads to a drastic change in policy which will curb these companies from taking over the market, or instead permit greater freedom business-wise; it is absolutely certain, however, that it will lead to a change in policy, for better or for worse.</p>","fields":{"slug":"17-january-2021-big-tech-outdated-laws-or-illicit-practices"},"frontmatter":{"title":"17 January 2021 Big Tech: Outdated Laws or Illicit Practices?","date":"17.01.2021","category":"Politics","tags":["Technology","Amazon","Government"],"banner":"/assets/bg/politics-bg.jpg"},"timeToRead":6}},"pageContext":{"slug":"17-january-2021-big-tech-outdated-laws-or-illicit-practices","prev":{"excerpt":"Introduction I recently came across a project involving a 3D printed digital sundial on a YouTube channel Mojoptix.

What I really had to do was simulate sunlight realistically. The Eureka moment came when I\nrealized I could use the animating software Blender in order to run a simulation with sunlight and the sundial. I imported the digital design of the sundial into OpenSCAD. The sundial had the\nbasic structure of a conventional one, but it also had slits to display hours, minutes and seconds. It had a pivot joint to adjust for latitude and came as one version for the northern hemisphere\nand a different version for the southern hemisphere.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Sundial1.png\" alt=\"The Mojoptix Sundial in OpenSCAD\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nThe Mojoptix Sundial in OpenSCAD\n</p>\n<p>I made some necessary adjustments and then imported the Sundial into Blender. In Blender, I placed the sundial on a plane, added a source of light and animated it according to the positions of the\nSun at various times of the day. Then, I entered these coordinates into Blender and ran the animation. It worked perfectly on my very first try! The sundial displayed the time of the day in 20-minute\nintervals as the light source went from east to west, simulating the Sun.</p>\n<h2 id=\"mathematical-details\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#mathematical-details\" aria-label=\"mathematical details permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Mathematical Details</h2>\n<p>What was important in this approach was to get the coordinate system of the Sundial correct in 3D space. The alignment was done with respect to 28.5deg North latitude for Delhi. It took some time\nfor me to grasp the trigonometry details of how to calculate the Sun\\rquote s path at each minute of the day. The Sun is positioned at a certain altitude from the horizontal and at a certain azimuth from\ngeographical North. For any sundial arm of length R, the shadow can be calculated using the equations described at many websites. Initially, I tried to understand and program this from the site\n{{\\field{*\\fldinst{HYPERLINK <a href=\"https://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Secliptc.htm\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Secliptc.htm</a> }}{\\fldrslt{<a href=\"https://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Secliptc.htm%5Cul0%5Ccf0%7D%7D%7D%7D%5Cf0%5Cfs22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">https://www-spof.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Secliptc.htm\\ul0\\cf0}}}}\\f0\\fs22</a> . Eventually, I realized that the python pysolar library (from {{\\field{*\\fldinst{HYPERLINK <a href=\"http://www.pysolar.org\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://www.pysolar.org</a> }}{\\fldrslt{<a href=\"http://www.pysolar.org%5Cul0%5Ccf0%7D%7D%7D%7D%5Cf0%5Cfs22\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow noopener noreferrer\">http://www.pysolar.org\\ul0\\cf0}}}}\\f0\\fs22</a>  ) does the same thing more easily. I then used pysolar by writing a python program as below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Sundial2.png\" alt=\"Python program\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nPython program\n</p>\n<p>The output of my python script gives for each time the exact x,y,z coordinates of the Sun. I positioned a light source in Blender at this position and then animated this over the course of the whole\nday.

I managed to use trigonometry for this\nprogram. Most importantly, I was able to prove my sundial worked even though I didn\\rquote t have any 3D printer. I am now generalizing the program for positioning the sundial for any place on Earth for any\ngiven time and day.  I really enjoyed this project because of the new skills that I learnt.</p>","id":"7c79b226-bb35-551d-97e3-5472955f8147","fields":{"slug":"23-apr-2020-a-3-d-printed-digital-sundial"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-04-23","title":"23 Apr 2020: A 3D Printed Digital Sundial","category":"Coding","tags":["3D Printing","Sundial","Animation","Blender"],"banner":"/assets/bg/computer-bg-1.jpg"},"timeToRead":3},"next":{"excerpt":"TOn January 6, 2021, a mob of pro-Trump rioters overwhelmed security at the US Capitol and stormed the building even as the election results were being certified.

They disrupted proceedings and the members of Congress had to be rushed out in an emergency evacuation. The shocking event resulted in the death of four rioters and Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who succumbed to his injuries overnight.</p>\n<p>The mob started going to towards the Capitol after Donald Trump’s rally, which is largely being seen as the catalyst for the violent reaction of his supporters. In his address to the gathering, Trump reiterated what he has already said numerous times: the election was rigged. His speech included sentences like “We will never concede. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.” He also stated, multiple times, that they would “go to the Capitol”, which emboldened the supporters and further fanned the flame. After this, they started marching towards Capitol Hill, even as security vehicles tried to catch up with the angry mob and stop them from reaching the Capitol.</p>\n<p>The events which unfolded after this are common knowledge. The fact of the matter is, this should never even have happened. Trump should not have agitated the protestors in the first place, but even more shocking was his reluctance to put out a video on his infamous Twitter handle condemning the violence. He finally agreed to do so, but convincing him should not have been difficult. In fact, he should not have even needed convincing. A President should be capable enough to recognise a violent situation.</p>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, that video was followed by a tweet calling his supporters ‘great patriots’ and telling them that they will ‘remember this day forever’. Twitter flagged the tweet, and has subsequently suspended him permanently from the platform.</p>\n<p>After the Electoral College certified his victory, President-elect Joe Biden said that those who were part of the mob cannot be called protestors, but should be labelled as ‘domestic terrorists’. He also called Trump a President ‘who has made his contempt for our democracy, our constitution and the rule of law clear in everything he has done’.</p>\n<p>Trump has repeatedly denied the election results and refused to accept his defeat, but to actually incite a breach of the Capitol to interrupt election certification proceedings was unprecedented. Not anymore, though. The situation is so fragile that Senators are actually worried about what havoc Trump might cause in the last 2 weeks of his term. An impeachment is being contemplated. There is a growing call for Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and to remove Trump from office immediately, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi supporting both options. Suffice to say, one of the world’s most prominent democracies shouldn’t be worrying about what violence their President might cause in the last few days he is in office. The very fact that this is happening is disturbing.</p>\n<p> A move for an impeachment would be more symbolic than realistic, since there isn’t enough time for a Senate trial. An increasing number of Senators are willing to take any route to remove Trump before his term ends, and if not remove him, proceed with the impeachment in order to follow up with the consequences of his actions. Trump should get what he deserves for the violence he caused, in any way possible.</p>\n<p>The efforts of Mike Pence and the other Republicans who eventually certified the results in the Electoral College should be appreciated, but the fact remains that it shouldn’t have taken so much violence for them to take the reasonable (and fairly obvious) decision. Pence, especially, was in a very delicate position when Trump falsely tweeted that the Vice President has the power to reject fraudulent voters. He was increasingly pressured by Trump to defy the constitution and not certify Biden’s victory, even though he has absolutely no power to do so. Pence did eventually acknowledge that he did not have the right to overturn the election in a letter to the members of Congress, in a rare instance of him going against Trump. He has largely remained loyal to the President and spent the last four years defending him and his decisions. What is most important, however, is that Pence did the right thing this time. If Pence had been as adamant as Trump and failed to see reason, something even worse and catastrophic might have happened.</p>\n<p>In the end, what has happened cannot be undone. The US Capitol was breached for the first time since the 1814 Burning of Washington, more than 200 years ago. That incident was caused by the British, not a protest incited by the sitting President. Trump has certainly made things much harder for Biden, as the US continues to lose respect on the international domain. The country has been weakened from within, and with America’s closest allies not remaining as close any longer, Biden might have not one but two big challenges to deal with at the very start of his Presidential term. The 2021 storming of the Capitol might be eventually seen as an isolated incident, but it is the exclamation mark on one of the most controversial presidential terms ever.</p>","id":"fe2b8537-744a-59b1-bcfa-a8c2edf3ae7b","fields":{"slug":"9-january-2021-the-storming-of-the-us-capitol"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-02-09","title":"9 January 2021: The Storming of the US Capitol","category":"Politics","tags":["US Capitol","Insurrection"],"banner":"/assets/bg/politics-bg.jpg"},"timeToRead":3}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3824141623"]}
