Oftentimes, we fail to discern what is real and separate it from that which is not; such failure almost always begets dangerous consequences. An incessant belief in or pursuit of unrealistic dreams, goals, or destinations can cause irreparable damage to one’s life. This perilous path is precisely the one down which Jay Gatsby travels in F. Scott Fitzgerald’s eternally relevant novel, The Great Gatsby. Born as Jimmy Gatz, he fashions a new name, personality, and life for himself, with the unfaltering belief that he can make his life what he wants to. His death in the closing stages of the novel — after he has lost everything he had gained — overshadows his achievements and leads readers to assume that his attempt to become Jay Gatsby failed absolutely. Gatsby seems to have become obsessed with a world that was not real. However, a more careful analysis of Gatz and his journey suggests otherwise.</p>\n<p>The novel revolves around Gatz’s aim to transform himself into the titular character, with Fitzgerald giving the reader a valuable perspective on this mission through his writing. Throughout the novel, the author demonstrates Gatz’s eagerness to be recognised as a true aristocrat by describing his various attempts to achieve this aim. After earning a fortune through his illicit partnership with Meyer Wolfshiem, he buys an extravagant mansion in West Egg, starts throwing meretricious parties and building his reputation. He has several shelves full of books, which he has never read, with the sole purpose of giving the impression of an educated man. Gatz repeatedly uses the phrase “old sport”—which was used by wealthy people in England and America during the 1920s—to appear as a person who comes from old money. Similarly, he continuously harps about being an “Oxford man” to further enhance his stature. Both these attempts to be seen as old money come across as unnatural to Jordan and Tom, and are immediately caught by them. In Chapter Three, Jordan expresses her disbelief about Gatz having gone to Oxford, saying, “I just don’t think he went there” (54). In Chapter Seven, Tom contemptuously questions Gatz’s catchphrase when he remarks, “That’s a great expression of yours, isn’t it?”(135) Through these two events, Fitzgerald portrays just how difficult Gatz’s task is: it is almost impossible to successfully mingle with old money if one has not originally been a part of it.</p>\n<p>Gatz’s ardor for being a part of the upper class is also represented by one of the major themes in the novel: his obsession with Daisy. He sees Daisy as a member of the class he wants to be a part of, and thus sees her as a means to achieve his ultimate goal of becoming “The Great Gatsby”; Fitzgerald demonstrates as much through Gatz’s description of Daisy and his actions related to her. When he first gets to know Daisy, Nick describes his feelings as follows:</p>\n<p>She was the first ‘nice’ girl he had ever known. In various unrevealed capacities he had come in contact with such people but always with indiscernible barbed wire between. He found her excitingly desirable . . . It excited him too that many men had already loved Daisy—it increased her value in his eyes. (158-159)</p>\n<p>This description gives valuable insight into what exactly it is that Gatz sees in Daisy. He finds her “excitingly desirable,” and additionally talks about how he had “never been in such a beautiful house before”(158). The mention of “shining motor cars,” and the fact that many men had loved Daisy previously was important to Gatz and “increased her [Daisy’s] value in his eyes,” corroborate the hypothesis that he was attracted more to Daisy’s wealth and status than to Daisy as a person. He perceives Daisy almost like one would do a valuable asset; high demand for it makes the asset seem even more important. Keeping in mind the context of reality and illusion in this analysis, it is worthwhile to note that Gatz makes a conscious choice to be blinded by fantasy during his initial days with Daisy. He acknowledges this in Chapter Eight, as Nick describes: “However glorious might be his future as Jay Gatsby, he was at present a penniless young man without a past, and at any moment the invisible cloak of his uniform might slip from his shoulders” (159). Nick also mentions how Gatz had “deliberately given Daisy a sense of security,”(159) even though he knew that this sense of security was false. Five years later, he remains convinced that Daisy is the epitome of the sophisticated class, and being with her is the one way he can achieve his dream. When Nick mentions Daisy’s voice in Chapter Seven, Gatz remarks, “Her voice is full of money” (128). Through this dialogue, Fitzgerald portrays what Daisy and her voice represent to him: the promise of wealth and status. The subsequent description further heightens the concept of Daisy being a highly sought after prize; Nick describes Daisy as “[h]igh in a white palace the king’s daughter, the golden girl” (128). In summary, it is only fair to conclude that Jimmy Gatz was not in love with Daisy, and rather it was the idea of being with Daisy and the value she would bring to his image that he fancied more.</p>\n<p>During the transitory period in Chapter Five when Gatz looked on course to obtain all he wanted, Fitzgerald gives the reader a glimpse of how much he wants to achieve his dream. Nick describes Gatz’s elation regarding his successful reunion with Daisy as having “an inconceivable pitch of intensity” (99). This elation is in complete contrast with the heavy, dejected atmosphere that Fitzgerald builds leading up to and after Gatz’s death. The tragic ending of the novel seems to suggest at face value that Gatz failed miserably in his desperate but unwavering mission of becoming Jay Gatsby. However, when one looks at how far Gatz came and how much he achieved in life, it becomes apparent that he did transform into Jay Gatsby, if only at a fundamental level.</p>\n<p>Fitzgerald also offers hope in Chapter Nine, notably through Gatz’s father. The introduction of his father symbolizes a return to his roots for Gatz, and Fitzgerald uses it to remind the reader that, despite all his faults, he did achieve what he wanted to from a fundamental perspective. His father’s amazement and disbelief at seeing his possessions demonstrate how monumental a task Gatz had done, building up his life from nothing. His father’s reaction says it all: “[When he] saw the height and splendour of the hall and the great rooms opening out from it into other rooms, his grief began to be mixed with an awed pride” (179). Only a person who came from humble origins, like his father, could comprehend and fully appreciate the effort and dogged attitude it must have taken to come from a poor family in North Dakota and then live in a posh mansion at the heart of the upper class in West Egg, New York. His father remained convinced that, irrespective of his death, Gatz had a “big future in front of him.”(184) Fitzgerald uses this belief to suggest that Jimmy Gatz did become Jay Gatsby in the eyes of his father and, considering that his father is the only character in the novel who comes from the same background as Gatz, this perspective is especially important. It is also worth noting that, regardless of the faults that Nick notices in Gatz over the course of the novel, Nick ultimately becomes his friend, admiring him for his steadfast belief, if nothing else. Through their friendship and Nick’s admiration, Fitzgerald proposes that Nick believed in Jay Gatsby as well.</p>\n<p>In the end, Jimmy Gatz lived as he thought life should be lived: reaching out for his dreams day after day. By describing Gatz’s journey and how far he had come, the author offers an illuminating perspective on the American dream and suggests that Gatz did transform himself into his desired reality of Jay Gatsby, if not in the absolute way he had envisaged. This positive takeaway from the novel is especially relevant in today’s world. There are many young people in America who have the potential as well as the opportunity to make invaluable contributions to society, but they ultimately do not do so because the option is not safe or is out of their comfort zone. Fitzgerald offers the perfect inspiration for such promising individuals by showing that Gatz succeeded in incorporating himself into the impenetrable upper class of the 1920s, even if he was not fully accepted there. Gatz's journey makes the reader realize that there is no light without the dark; accomplishments are great and worth achieving only if there are obstacles that require grit and determination to overcome. As Nick notes at the very end of The Great Gatsby, Gatz believed in “the green light, the orgastic future”(193) that always seems to be just out of reach. Even in the face of death, he is prepared to keep going, his boat against the current; perhaps that is what makes him “The Great Gatsby,” after all.</p>","fields":{"slug":"26-february-2021-jimmy-gatz-and-jay-gatsby-reality-versus-fantasy-in-the-great-gatsby"},"frontmatter":{"title":"26 February 2021: Jimmy Gatz and Jay Gatsby- Reality versus Fantasy in The Great Gatsby","date":"26.02.2021","category":"Literature","tags":["Gatsby","Literature"],"banner":"/assets/bg/politics-bg.jpg"},"timeToRead":6}},"pageContext":{"slug":"26-february-2021-jimmy-gatz-and-jay-gatsby-reality-versus-fantasy-in-the-great-gatsby","prev":{"excerpt":"In September 1962, the CIA prepared a Special National Intelligence Estimate (SNIE) on “The Military Buildup in Cuba” after U-2 plane missions flown over Cuba found that surface-to-air missiles were arriving in the Caribbean country from the Soviet…","html":"<p>In September 1962, the CIA prepared a Special National Intelligence Estimate (SNIE) on “The Military Buildup in Cuba” after U-2 plane missions flown over Cuba found that surface-to-air missiles were arriving in the Caribbean country from the Soviet Union. Images collected in October 1962 confirmed the worst fears of the USA and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. At the same time, another conflict with huge implications was taking shape in the Himalayas. On October 20 1962, Mao Zedong’s Red China attacked India on its western and northeast borders in two different but simultaneous strikes a thousand kilometres apart. As John F. Kennedy and his Cabinet dealt with the Cuban Missile Crisis, the President, with the support of his extremely competent Indian ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith, handled the equally dangerous Sino-Indian conflict, the titular event in JFK’s Forgotten Crisis by Bruce Riedel.</p>\n<p>JFK’s Forgotten Crisis seeks to provide insight into and give credit for JFK’s pivotal role in the Sino-Indian tensions, which had been largely ignored until the writing of this book. Riedel focuses on the incredibly delicate position JFK was in during the peak of both crises; the back cover of the book describes the time as “the most dangerous days of the entire cold war”. The Cuban Missile crisis has been extensively written about from various perspectives. While the 1962 Sino-Indian war has since been analysed by Indians in an effort to understand what resulted in such a humiliating defeat for them, Americans have forgotten what their own President did to defuse this international conflict. The critical contribution of Riedel’s book lies in this very fact. It demonstrates how JFK simultaneously managed two international conflicts, and how he managed them exceedingly well\n.\nThe book touches on several important themes relating to the time period between the 1950’s and the 1970’s. Examining these in detail is essential to developing an in-depth understanding of Riedel’s novel. One of the recurring points in the book is foreign relations between the US, and India and Pakistan, as well as the changes in these relationships with time. Riedel spends a significant amount of time analysing the relationships between the American and Indian leaders and describes how these relationships played an important role in defusing Sino-Indian tensions. A special mention is given to Nehru’s 1956 visit to Eisenhower’s Gettysburg farm where the two leaders spent fourteen hours talking about various issues. In an accurate summary of US-India relations during the 1950s, the author notes that “the two did not come to agreement on all issues or even most, but Eisenhower concluded that he “liked Prime Minister Nehru”.” (Riedel, 10) An important point in the context of the Sino-Indian war is that Eisenhower and Nehru had very different views on China. Nehru, a prominent leader of the Non-Alignment Movement (NAM) which began amid the Cold War, wanted to maintain amicable relations with its communist neighbor and even requested Eisenhower to grant China a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council. Eisenhower refused to consider it with China’s role in the Korean war being “fresh in his memory.” (Riedel, 10) The transition from Eisenhower to Kennedy also saw a gradual but definite shift in the US stance in South-East Asia. This became evident when the US started to back India publicly in October 1962 on its border dispute with China and started to provide arms to support India’s military against the strong Chinese forces. The policy shift towards India is further corroborated by the fact that Kennedy provided arms for India despite explicitly promising Ayub Khan, Pakistan’s military dictator, in 1961 that he would not do so without consulting Pakistan first.</p>\n<p>The author writes extensively about John Kenneth Galbraith and his pivotal role in the Sino-Indian crisis. He ends the book by saying the world was fortunate to have JFK and Galbraith in those testing times and, judging by Galbraith’s contribution, this is not an exaggeration. He describes how Kennedy and Galbraith had a very close relationship; Kennedy even offered personally intervening and getting him an exemption from Harvard when Galbraith had to go back and resume his teaching duties. Riedel also mentions how Galbraith said in his diary that Washington was “totally occupied with Cuba” (Riedel, 119) at the peak of the Sino-Indian war. Galbraith did not receive any significant communication or advice with regards to the escalating tensions on the North-East border. Riedel observes that this was probably for the best. Galbraith was extremely well informed, had good intuition and relied on himself to take critical decisions. He notes, “During this period Galbraith did receive one message from the State Department, but characteristically chose to challenge it.” (Riedel, 120) Kennedy trusted Galbraith, and his trust was not misplaced. Galbraith handled the crisis extremely well. While Kennedy and Washington defused the Cuban tensions, he let Galbraith handle the other big conflict. Riedel says, “It is clear that Kennedy felt that Galbraith and he made up the right team to tackle the war in India largely on their own.” (Riedel, 117) It is worthwhile to note that Galbraith had an amicable relationship with Jawaharlal Nehru as well, and he gradually became an important advisor to Nehru especially in matters related to Chinese aggression. JFK’s Forgotten Crisis thus duly gives credit to another figure largely ignored by American history and literature: John Kenneth Galbraith. Along with Kennedy, he established good relations with India which would surely have led to a concrete partnership in the longer term, but for Kennedy’s sudden assassination.</p>\n<p>Continuing with the theme of American-Indian relations, Riedel describes how American relations with India looked set to continue improving under Kennedy after positive initial exchanges. On November 19, 1962, when Sino-Indian tensions were at their highest and India’s situation was growing desperate, Nehru wrote two letters to Kennedy asking for extensive military assistance from the US to avoid Chinese occupation of the entire North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA). On the same day, Kennedy decided to send Ambassador Averell Harriman to India to understand India’s military requirements. Fortunately for India, Chinese leader Mao announced a unilateral ceasefire the next day, implicitly forcing Nehru to accept it due to India’s dire situation, and thus ending the war as it had begun: on China’s terms. The ceasefire gave Harriman’s mission time to assess India’s military needs without having to respond immediately. Harriman and his team had three primary objectives. The first one was increasing US military aid to India. In 1963, The United States and the UK facilitated the training of American, British, Australian, and Canadian pilots in India with bombers and jet fighters. The US and the UK also provided arms for mountain divisions of the Indian Army. Additionally, Kennedy agreed to a $500 million military package for India over five years.\nHarriman’s second goal involved initiating India-Pakistan negotiations on the Kashmir dispute. In a rare instance of Kennedy ignoring his Indian ambassador Galbraith’s advice, JFK tried to pursue a peaceful settlement. Negotiations did not go well, and Pakistan’s simultaneous and separate border deal with China - which involved Pakistan giving territory which allegedly belonged to India, to China - “symbolized Pakistan’s new entente with Communist China, the enemy of America and India.” (Riedel, 155-156) Kennedy’s attempt to settle the Kashmir issue instead led to the atrophying of his relations with the Pakistani leaders, including Ayub Khan and his foreign minister Zulfikar Bhutto.\nThe third and final objective Harriman had was to secure Indian support for the covert missions CIA had been carrying out in Tibet since Eisenhower. The CIA was secretly supporting a Tibetan rebellion against China. An elaborate operation had been created over time, which included training Tibetan rebels in Colorado and then parachuting them into Tibet from East Pakistan air bases. As Kennedy’s relations with Pakistan soured - with Ayub Khan persistently threatening to shut down the Tibet operation if the US tilt towards India did not stop - Washington decided to get India’s support for the mission instead. After a series of discussions with the CIA’s Near East (NE) division, India’s head of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), B.N. Mullik agreed to support the Tibetan rebellion. India started to help the Colorado trainees in infiltrating the Line of Actual Control (LOAC) and getting into Tibet. India also helped in training Tibetans who started patrolling along the LOAC and collecting intelligence on the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA).</p>\n<p>Despite all this cooperation, India and the United States failed to capitalize on the improvements in their relations and cement a strategic alliance. Nehru was disappointed with the military aid package, as was Kenneth Galbraith. When Nehru requested aid worth $1.3 billion, Kennedy was only able to promise less than half of that value. After Kennedy’s assassination, the military aid package was suspended under Lyndon Johnson and remained so for several months before a meeting was scheduled to take a final decision in May 1964. Unfortunately, a day before the meeting, Nehru suddenly died. Nehru’s successor Lal Bahadur Shastri was “eager to close an arms deal,” (Riedel, 163) and when the Soviets made a multiyear military aid offer, India accepted it in what was a “lost opportunity in Indo-American relations”. (Riedel, 163) Thus, one of the key points of JFK’s Forgotten Crisis is Indian-American relations, and how the “unforeseeable events” (Riedel, 163) of Kennedy’s assassination and Nehru’s death “stymied Kennedy’s goal of building a new long-term strategic partnership with India.” (Riedel, 163) Riedel argues that India and the United States would have enjoyed a considerably closer alliance today if JFK had continued to be President.</p>\n<p>Another critical aspect Riedel analyses in great detail is the evolution of US Intelligence and its essential role in the Korean War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Tibetan resistance and the Sino-Indian war. In October 1950, Mao sent a massive number of troops to assist North Korea in the Korean War and ward off the advancing American and South Korean forces. In a fatal move, General Douglas MacArthur - the man in charge of the American troops - had prohibited any outside intelligence (including the CIA) from interfering in his decisions. He had his own intelligence set up in Tokyo, and this intelligence centre continuously downplayed the threat of the Chinese forces in wait for the advancing US troops. The estimate Tokyo provided on the number of Chinese troops in Korea was less than one-tenth of the actual number. MacArthur had also assured President Truman and said that China would not be able to mount a realistic attack on his forces. When the two armies did meet, MacArthur’s and South Korea’s forces were destroyed. As a result of this grave intelligence blunder, the CIA was brought in and it became the irreplaceable intelligence agency for the US. Riedel describes how India had tried to warn Washington about the advancing Chinese forces only to be ignored and uses this incident as a starting point to extensively examine Indo-American relations. He also states that the Korean War played a large part in convincing the American public that China was “a crazy communist state.” (Riedel, 20)</p>\n<p>Riedel focuses on clandestine CIA operations, especially the rebellion in Tibet, to a great extent. In 1957, Allen Dulles, the Director of the CIA, launched a Tibetan rebellion with Pakistan’s help which involved training Tibetan rebels to resist military aggression from China and to protect their homeland, as described earlier on Page 3. The author correctly argues that this CIA operation had big consequences which still exist in Asian politics today. He has described how Ayub Khan used the CIA operations as a trump card, and repeatedly threatened to shut them down if the US continued to side with India. The biggest consequence, however, was the Chinese invasion of India in 1962. He argues that Mao was paranoid about an India-US alliance and thought that it was this partnership which was fuelling the Tibetan rebellion. Mao wrongly thought that instead of Pakistan, it was India who was secretly helping the CIA and the Tibetan rebels. Riedel observes, “It is, of course, deeply ironic that the Chinese invasion of India prompted close American-Indian intelligence cooperation, because in part Mao's paranoia about American-Indian collusion in Tibet prompted the invasion.” (Riedel, 160) The Chinese invasion also led to Pakistan allying with China as Kennedy continued to support India while trying to keep the Pakistan operations going. The other covert operation that the CIA was carrying out with the help of Pakistan and which is mentioned briefly in the book involved flying U-2 spy planes over the Soviet Union to collect intelligence about the communist state. This mission experienced a severe setback in 1960 when the Soviets shot down a U-2 aircraft and exposed the US operations to the world; the CIA subsequently stopped these reconnaissance flights after Eisenhower told the agency “it was too dangerous.” (Riedel, 41) The CIA continued its Tibet operation, however; it lasted throughout Kennedy’s presidency until it morphed into the agreement with India described on Page 4 even as Pakistan shifted its support from the United States to Communist China.</p>\n<p>Riedel also analyses Pakistan’s foreign policies and decisions with great detail, which is only natural considering how important a role the country played in the Sino-Indian war and the conflicts India was dealing with at the time. He describes Pakistan as “eager to find a foreign protector” (Riedel, 28-29); he strongly suggests the country entered into two military alliances (CENTO and SEATO) with the US primarily to achieve this objective. He says, “By the mid-1950s, Pakistanis could claim to be America’s most allied ally.” (Riedel, 29) He also explicitly observes that “Pakistan had allied itself with the United States in the SEATO and CENTO alliances to strengthen its armed forces to fight India, not Russia or China.” (Riedel, 128) As mentioned earlier, Ayub Khan was increasingly upset about the American support for India and repeatedly tried to threaten the CIA that he would shut down their secret Tibet operations. One of the reasons the Pakistani leader slowly drifted towards China and away from the US was the Kashmir dispute; he desperately wanted Kashmir to be a part of his country. He even tried to create an exchange offer during the Sino-Indian war when he proposed that Pakistan would maintain a ceasefire on India’s western boundaries if India gave up Kashmir. He pressed Kennedy to make this offer an integral part of any Indo-Pakistan negotiations. Riedel gives immense credit to Galbraith here, who correctly advised Kennedy that Nehru would never consider this offer; as a result of this, Kennedy never considered Khan’s proposal and made no promises about Kashmir. Ayub Khan’s attempt to capitalize on China’s aggression failed.</p>\n<p>This brings us to another key point in the book: Communist China. In what is otherwise a very neutral narration and analysis, Riedel gives credit to Mao for his brilliant strategy in winning its 1962 border war. He quotes a CIA report, saying that “China played on Nehru's Asian, anti-imperialist mental attitude; his proclivity to temporize, and his sincere desire for an amicable Sino-Indian relationship.” (Riedel, 26) This strategy used by China was a masterpiece; the country avoided making explicit border statements which would be controversial but did not retract any of its previous claims either. Riedel spends considerable time scrutinizing Prospects of Communist China, a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) delivered by the CIA in May 1962. He notes how the report described the economic slowdown China had experienced due to Mao’s aggressive policy known as “Great Leap Forward.” He also analyses the Soviet-China fallout at this point in the book. The two communist giants had disagreed on how to fight the cold war; and “virtually all Soviet technicians and advisers, both in economic and military aid projects, had departed suddenly.” (Riedel, 84) Riedel describes on several occasions how Mao spared no effort in occupying Tibet, and how he committed a huge number of troops to crush the Tibetan rebellion being sponsored by the CIA. Riedel quotes the CIA’s Tibet Task Force chief, saying “Mao refused to let bands of unruly border tribesmen deny him his dream of reuniting the greater Han empire.” (Riedel, 86)</p>\n<p>The author thus uses these themes to narrate the Sino-Indian war. JFK’s Forgotten Crisis essentially seeks to tell the story of a largely ignored political crisis and bring its events to light. Riedel himself writes, “Kennedy’s critical role in the Sino-Indian War of 1962 has also been largely ignored. This book seeks to fill that lacuna.” (Riedel, 3) This was clearly his primary objective: to grab the attention of the American public and educate them about this important world event. From this historical aspect, Riedel succeeds spectacularly. He provides an immensely elaborate description of events leading up to the Sino-Indian tensions, the war itself and the aftermath. Towards the end, he uses descriptions of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 which saw active Pakistani-Chinese cooperation, and the 1971 war which led to the creation of Bangladesh, to transition into modern Asian politics and its relation with the 1962 war. Thus, he covers every event punctiliously and paints a clear picture for every kind of reader, whether it is a fellow diplomat or a complete beginner in foreign policy. Considering that he aimed to educate the general public about the Sino-Indian war and the policy decisions behind it, he has done an excellent job in making this book a simple yet diligent study.</p>\n<p>JFK’s Forgotten Crisis is also an intricate study of foreign policy. Riedel examines Communist China, its decisions and the reasons behind these decisions. He devotes an entire section to analyse why the Chinese withdrew from NEFA and retreated behind the McMahon Line (the border drawn by the British). He looks at China and its ambitions from Mao’s perspective and consequently develops sound, well-thought-out conclusions. He describes how Mao’s primary objective was to humiliate Nehru and India and to prove that communism was the superior system in “the contest for Asia between the People’s Republic of China and democratic India.” (Riedel, 142) By routing India’s inferior army in NEFA, Riedel points out, Mao had achieved his aim. He argues that by retreating and declaring a ceasefire, Mao achieved gains in the present and for the future. He says that Mao demonstrated “restraint” (Riedel, 142) by retreating, and supports this with evidence, saying,  “China would later point to its restraint in November 1962 as a sign that it was a responsible member of the international community and should be given its seat in the UN Security Council.” (Riedel, 142) He notes that in addition to logistical issues, Mao must also have known that further aggression and an attempt to occupy all of North-East India “would have forced Kennedy’s hand.” (Riedel, 142) Riedel describes the US and UK military assistance that India received in detail and thus helps the reader envision the strong message that this aid sent to China, and Mao’s subsequent reluctance to continue the military aggression.</p>\n<p>The book is heavily based on decision making. Through several examples, Riedel slowly helps the reader to build an accurate impression of how decisions are taken in different types of administrations and also notes how costly conflicts and misunderstandings within administrations can be. He uses the Bay of Pigs fiasco to describe the latter. He describes how Kennedy was certain about not using the Marines and the Navy as a backup for the planned invasion, and how the CIA did not believe he was serious about reducing American involvement. He writes, “Thus there was a complete policy disconnect between the White House and the CIA on the plan: Kennedy thought he was supporting an operation that was plausibly deniable if it went wrong, whereas Dulles was convinced his plan would be backed up by the U.S. military if anything went amiss. This fundamental difference between the policymaker and the covert operator doomed the mission.” (Riedel, 53)</p>\n<p>Riedel devotes an entire chapter to Galbraith and additionally talks about his role in the other ones, a testament to Galbraith’s importance in the 1962 war, and in Indian affairs from an American perspective in general. He narrates Galbraith’s increasing influence in Kennedy and Nehru’s decision making and describes the ambassador as a straightforward, efficient and responsible diplomat. He gives several examples to demonstrate how Galbraith knew exactly how Nehru would respond to any situation and was able to accordingly send suitable advice to Washington and Kennedy. Thus, Riedel succeeds in providing an excellent insight into diplomacy as well.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Riedel aims to study leadership. He extensively covers Kennedy’s presidency and analyses decisions made by him; when they were correct, he gives the reasons Kennedy took this decision, and when they were wrong, he narrates and examines what led to an incorrect decision. He feels it is important to study Kennedy’s leadership because in his opinion, “How Kennedy managed two crises on opposite sides of the globe holds lessons for decisionmakers today.” (Riedel, 5) Riedel closes his book by stating the important lessons learnt from Kennedy’s presidency. The first lesson, he says, is about carefully and personally picking their top intelligence officials from among their trusted aides. He says, “ “The truth will set you free” should be more than a motto: It must be continually put into action.” (Riedel, 177) He emphasizes the importance of intelligence officials who will prefer telling bad news as opposed to telling the President what they want to hear. Riedel earlier corroborates this by stating the example of the intelligence fiasco in the Korean War, and Kennedy’s mistake in the Bay of Pigs disaster. Another important lesson, according to him, is that Presidents must do all they can to make covert partnerships effective, like JFK appeased the upset Ayub Khan with a dinner at Mount Vernon in May 1961, resulting in the resumption of CIA’s clandestine Tibet operations. Riedel ends by praising Kennedy’s decision to not go to war in Cuba despite his experts telling him to, and also lauds Kennedy’s wisdom in trusting Galbraith and giving him the authority to handle the Sino-Indian crisis.</p>\n<p>Riedel additionally examines Nehru and his leadership in the book. He credibly observes how many of Nehru’s decisions were based on his domestic political position. He keeps in mind that Nehru was fixated on remaining neutral in the cold war and that he wanted India to be self-sufficient. This allows him to understand as well as explain why Nehru seemed to be mentally exhausted towards the end of the Sino-Indian crisis: relying on the US was strictly against his principles; he “had fought for independence for so long from the West.” (Riedel, 128) Accepting Western support hurt Nehru’s pride.</p>\n<p>JFK’s Forgotten Crisis has a few missing elements, but despite this, Riedel has done an outstanding job. He himself avers that the book would have been much more complete if it had included references to Chinese official documents and their analysis. It is not the author’s fault that China does not release any policy documents, and he has done a marvellous job despite missing the official version of the story of one of the two main countries in the crisis. Likewise, the book could have included more inputs from the Indian side. Riedel does quote several works by Indians, including John P. Dalvi’s Himalayan Blunder and B.N. Mullik’s The Chinese Betrayal, but interviewing more people close to Nehru and more importantly, people who have a more neutral view would have resulted in a wider and more complete narration. It is important to note that both Mullik and Dalvi were personally involved in the crisis: Mullik was the head of the IB while Dalvi was in charge of the Fourth Division of the Army protecting the North-East border.\nIt is difficult to judge Riedel’s book given that it is arguably the first work which neutrally covers the Sino-Indian crisis. Regardless of this lack of precedent, it is fair to say the author has done a brilliant job to tell this extremely important story from four different perspectives: the US and the CIA, Pakistan, India and China. His work fills an important void in American foreign policy literature; as The Wall Street Journal said, “The greatest value in JFK’s Forgotten Crisis is the compelling answers it provides.” (Riedel, back cover)</p>\n<h2 id=\"bibliography\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#bibliography\" aria-label=\"bibliography permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Bibliography</h2>\n<p>Riedel, Bruce. <em>JFK's Forgotten Crisis: Tibet, the CIA, and the Sino-Indian War.</em> Brookings Institution Press, 2015.</p>","id":"09a3c426-17d1-5905-b15d-f45d56b265af","fields":{"slug":"15-february-2021-a-review-of-jf-ks-forgotten-crisis-by-bruce-riedel"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-02-15","title":"15 February 2021: A Review of JFK's Forgotten Crisis by Bruce Riedel","category":"Politics","tags":["Foreign Policy","Politics","South East Asia"],"banner":"/assets/bg/politics-bg.jpg"},"timeToRead":16},"next":{"excerpt":"The foreign policy of a country often provides valuable insight into its short-term and long-term objectives, as well as the nature of its relationships with other countries.

China’s foreign policy is perhaps one of the most intricate and carefully planned in the world today; consequently, it also gives a good idea of what China is aiming to achieve in the decades to come, the countries its vision includes as potential allies, and those it sees as a threat.</p>\n<p>Over the past several years, there have been multiple indications, directly from Chinese leaders and indirectly from their foreign policy decisions, that the country is actively pursuing a position at the top of the global hierarchy. History always provides a suitable lens to study the present; likewise, a look at Chinese history is necessary to fully understand the reasons and motivations behind current Chinese decisions.</p>\n<p>The period from 1839-1949 is often called China’s “Century of Humiliation,” as the Chinese empire was overpowered by Western powers like Britain and France, as well as Russia and Japan. This subjugation experienced by the Chinese empire is regarded as a defeat to be extremely ashamed of in China. It started in 1839 with the First Opium War against Britain when China tried to put an end to the illegal opium trade being carried out by the British since addiction to the drug was having a widespread impact on society. China lost this war badly, and the Second Opium War, in which France fought with Britain, had the same result. Subsequently, China lost a number of wars, especially against Japan, and the rulers also had to sign several treaties after each loss, giving away valuable territory; Britain additionally made China increase the number of ports that allowed British traders in an effort to increase British influence and trade in the region.</p>\n<p>These continuous losses finally led to the formation of the modern state of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Since then, the nation’s ambitions have been rising steeply. In a 2017 speech at the Party Congress, President Xi Jinping pledged to achieve the “Great Rejuvenation” of the country by 2049, the one-hundredth anniversary of the nation. The phrase is not new; Xi has been using this phrase to refer to sustainable yet accelerated development and a return to great heights since 2012. However, his 2017 speech provided more specificity and offered a multistage plan to achieve rejuvenation in a gradual manner across three time periods: 2020, 2035, and 2050. An important and especially relevant example his speech included was the military. Xi explained that the military would achieve mechanization by 2020, modernization by 2035, and would become a “world-class” military by 2050. Evidence of China’s intention to continue forward with this plan can be found in China’s 14th Five-Year Plan for 2021-2025. It envisions that China’s military will be fully “mechanized and informationized” by 2027.</p>\n<p>The 2017 speech also provides information about China’s plan on the global level. Xi stated that China would focus on “global combat capabilities” and that China would “move closer to the center of the world.” The President was also optimistic about China’s progression towards the role of global hegemon that it is actively pursuing; he stated that the level of multipolarity in world order was “rapidly accelerating,” implying that he thinks Chinese influence is increasing rapidly.</p>\n<p>To find more concrete signs of increasing Chinese influence in the world, one need not look farther than the principal global organization: The United Nations. Beijing has slowly started taking steps to replace the US from the leadership role in the UN - they have increased funding by more than five times even as the US stopped funding, and the number of Chinese personnel in the UN is also increasing at a significant rate. More than 25% of UN Specialized Agencies are now headed by Chinese nationals. China has also tried to introduce the notion of each country having its own human rights standards, with many labeling this as an attempt to popularize authoritarian rule. The United States would surely find these signs alarming. China is trying to replace and reduce US influence in any and all ways possible. These are further signs that the US might soon find itself in a much less promising position, with the exact opposite being true for China.</p>\n<p>Another example of Chinese strategy is its relations with other countries. China had a considerably tense relationship with North Korea not so long ago, with Beijing being concerned about North Korea’s growing nuclear capabilities. However, in what is another sign of calculated decision-making, China has revitalized its partnership with North Korea in recent times. While China still has concerns about North Korea’s nuclear prowess, it has now accepted this reality and is actively working to increase its influence in Asia in any way possible. China sees the lack of progress in US-North Korea talks as an opportunity to exert its own influence in the region while reducing American influence at the same time. Therefore, the Chinese strategy on the issue of North Korea has far-reaching implications for foreign policy and politics.</p>\n<p>China also abandoned its policy of neutrality in the conflict-ridden Middle-Eastern region in 2016. Realizing that the US has a strained relationship with both Iran and Saudi Arabia and that Russia will continue to remain neutral, China has seen economic opportunities and inserted itself into the conflict between the Middle Eastern countries. The region has a considerable portion of Earth’s conventional oil reserves and China’s manufacturing-focused economy’s need for resources like oil will only continue to rise.</p>\n<p>Finally, China has also sought to increase its influence across a large number of countries in regions like Eurasia, South Asia, Africa, and the Middle-East through its highly controversial Belt and Road Initiative(BRI). This initiative essentially involves China investing large amounts of money to build infrastructure for increased transportation and travel capabilities between these regions. The main motivation behind this initiative lies in finding new markets for Chinese commodities in order to provide a boost to the slowing Chinese economy. BRI is controversial because several Western countries and experts have claimed that the initiative is an attempt to make comparatively smaller economies fall into a debt-trap to gain strategic advantages for China. Once such countries fall into a debt-trap and cannot pay back, they are allegedly pressured by China to support its political and geo-strategic interests. For instance, Tajikistan fell into debt and had to cede about 1158 square kilometers of territory to China; the country still owes $1.2 billion to China. Former Tanzanian President John Magufuli called BRI deals “exploitative,” explaining that Beijing wanted Tanzania to give China guarantees and a 99 years lease on a port construction. Countries at risk of falling into debt trap include Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and many other South Asian nations.</p>\n<p>This is by no means a complete list of strategic Chinese decisions. Other steps taken by China include regional assertion, such as military aggression against India and the continued crackdown on Hong Kong. It is safe to conclude that China is aiming for and beyond the stars its flag also embodies; it is making every effort to have more than one reason to celebrate its hundred-year anniversary in 2049. While not necessarily alarming, China’s progress will certainly result in a wave of implications and consequences across the globe.</p>","id":"e566769d-8bc9-5c34-9e9e-f5d20b7fdd15","fields":{"slug":"15-april-2021-china-a-country-reaching-for-the-stars"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-04-15","title":"15 April 2021 China: A Country Reaching For The Stars","category":"Politics","tags":["China","Politics","Development"],"banner":"/assets/bg/politics-bg.jpg"},"timeToRead":5}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3824141623"]}
