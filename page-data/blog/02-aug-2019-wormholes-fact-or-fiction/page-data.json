It is most often visualised as a tunnel connecting two different points in the four-dimensional region of spacetime. </p>\n<p>I elaborated on the three main kinds of wormholes, their structure and the possibility of their existence with the help of models as follows:</p>\n<p><em>Einstein-Rosen bridges</em>: These are connections between areas of space that can be modelled as vacuum solutions to the Einstein field equations. Einstein-Rosen bridges work on the principles of a black hole, and its complete opposite, a white hole. The black hole takes matter in, as it normally does in the universe. A white hole is the exact opposite of a black hole(which means no matter can enter it), so it spews matter outwards. These are unlikely to exist since there are no possible processes that may form white holes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Wormhole1.jpg\" alt=\"Einstein-Rosen Bridge\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\"> An Einstein-Rosen Bridge</p>\n<p><em>String Theory Wormholes</em>: String theory wormholes are said to connect through strings called cosmic strings, which also keep them open. String theory wormholes were (probably) made during the Big Bang when quantum fluctuations (the temporary change in the amount of energy in a point in space) at the smallest scale (the Planck length- 1035 m) created many traversable wormholes. Then, by cosmic inflation, which was the rapid expansion of the universe just after the Big Bang, these wormholes increased in size, to the macroscopic scale, and were cast light-years apart in the interstellar medium. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Wormhole2.jpg\" alt=\"String Theory Wormhole\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\"> String Theory Wormhole</p>\n<p><em>Manmade Wormholes</em>: Man-made wormholes are created by propping open holes in spacetime, and keeping them open. This is done using exotic matter (matter with negative mass). So, instead of the attractive force of gravity, it will exert a repulsive force which could prop open wormholes. </p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I had a lot of fun working on this project since it involved a lot of research, cross-referencing and comparing different information.

Instead of the regular H-H nuclear fusion that occurs and releases energy in stars,\nbrown dwarfs primarily have lithium and deuterium fusion since they don’t quite have the temperature and density required for regular nuclear fusion. Brown dwarfs are very cool and hence\ndim. So, searching for them is difficult, even though they are thought to be more abundant than stars. The WISE telescope searched for IR radiation to identify brown dwarfs since most of the\nlight they emit is infrared.</p>\n<p>A ULIRG is a galaxy which primarily emits infrared light. The primary source of this IR light is dust, which is observed wherever stars are forming. Thus, ULIRGs may be found in galaxies which\nare merging and leading to bursts of star formation, which leads to collection of dust. ULIRGs emit even more light than brown dwarfs at the lower IR wavelengths.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#approach\" aria-label=\"approach permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Approach</h2>\n<p>We started this assignment by downloading the required images from the WISE Image Service. We downloaded the same image in three different wavelength bands, w1 (3.4 µm), w2 (4.6 µm) and w3\n(12 µm). We then used a finder chart to locate 12 different stars on all the 3 wavelengths. This was particularly difficult since some stars were harder to locate on specific wavelengths due to the\nchange in their brightness and intensity as the wavelength changed. It was also very confusing in the beginning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/WiseImage.png\" alt=\"The WISE Image\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\"> The WISE Image</p>\n<p>Using each star’s coordinates and its intensity, we calculated the ratio of the intensities for the different wavelengths. We used the ratios w3:w2 and w2:w1. I wrote a Java program for\ncalculating these values. We then plotted the colour-colour diagram(a kind of graph) for the twelve stars. We identified the brown dwarf by studying the position the stars occupied on the\ncolour-colour diagram.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/ColorColorDiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Color Color Diagram\"></p>\n<p align=\"Center\"> The Color Color Diagram</p>\n<p>Then, we repeated the same for the ULIRGs and identified the ULIRG using another colour- colour diagram. However, we then realised that the object we thought was a ULIRG could just be an\nextreme case of a brown dwarf. So, we used images of the same region from the Hubble Space Telescope(HST) to look at the object, since HST images are much more detailed. Upon intensive\nexamination, we noticed the faint trace of a spiral arm in the HST image, and this confirmed it was indeed an Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This was one of my favourite assignments in this course since I applied Computer Science to Astronomy while learning new things in both fields. I feel this was also a very rewarding\nassignment. It took me a total of 6 hours to plot the stars, collect the data and make the colour-colour diagram. Then, as you plot the graph, it all becomes worth the wait.

A diagram of the 6-state No-Quarantine model is shown below. We start with a population of 10,000 people, and we allow both healthy and sick to stay in one place with no quarantine or isolation at all. This means healthy individuals first contract the virus and are contagious without showing symptoms, contagious people eventually show symptoms, symptomatic people fall sick, sick people become critical, and some critically ill people die. We increment these 6-states into discrete 1-day timesteps. The probability of a person remaining in the same state is 0.9, and the probability of transitioning to the next state is 0.1. I obtained the graph for the Markov chain using Google Sheets, where I multiplied the probabilities of each transition with the number of people in that state for each day, and then plotted the graph of each day’s numbers. If we simulate this Markov chain, all people will eventually die, which is not a favorable scenario at all. This is shown in the results graph below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Image1.png\" alt=\"The Markov Chain\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nThe Markov Chain\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Image2.png\" alt=\"The Markov Chain\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nThe Graph for the Markov Chain\n</p>\n<p>Conclusions: In the first 7 days, 3000 people become contagious without knowing, only 1000 people show symptoms and there is only one death.

However, by just identifying symptomatic people and quarantining only half of them, we are able to “save” 8350 people. Finally, there are only 1650 deaths.</p>\n<h1 id=\"the-implications\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-implications\" aria-label=\"the implications permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Implications</h1>\n<p>I feel that this project shows just how much this situation depends on the response of the human community. From the first example, we see that if people do not quarantine at all, the virus can spread really fast and affect almost the entire population. This is of increased relevance in countries who have successfully countered the first wave of infections and are reopening. Returning to normal life without any precautions at all can have disastrous consequences. By quarantining just half of the total symptomatic population each day, we can save a huge number of people. Thus, this model shows how different decisions can have a huge impact on the result of the same situation, and how we must stay vigilant in order to minimize the damage caused by this pandemic.</p>","id":"ec83c840-b4f0-56cf-a4a1-1f5be121ab36","fields":{"slug":"20-feb-2020-modelling-the-coronavirus-using-markov-chains"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-02-20","title":"20 Feb 2020: Modelling the Coronavirus using Markov Chains","category":"Coding","tags":["Technology","Coronavirus","Markov Chains"],"banner":"/assets/bg/computer-bg-1.jpg"},"timeToRead":3}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3824141623"]}
