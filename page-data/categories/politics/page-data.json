Having just two main parties which can have a candidate elected as President can go either of two ways: the policies adopted by both parties are consistent with and complement each other in a positive feedback system, or,the two parties start adopting significantly opposing policies. The US has largely been subject to the latter situation. These two political parties have been diverging in terms of opinions for a long time, and the effects are increasingly noticeable.</p>\n<p>A 2014 study by Pew Research Center showed a significant increase in political polarization in the American public over the past years. It found that 92% of Republicans in the public had a more conservative (right-wing) position than the median (average) Democrat, while 94% of Democrats had a more liberal (left-wing) position than the median Republican. The percent of people in both parties who feel that the other party is unfavorable for the nation’s progress has also been steeply rising over the years, showing that party enmity and hatred is rising as more people shift to increasingly extreme positions in the political spectrum. Another interesting inference that the study made was that the more politically polarized groups were far more likely to engage in political activities such as voting or contributing to campaigns. People whose political opinions are mostly in the center are relatively inactive in politics, with people who are consistently liberal and consistently conservative voting the most and donating to campaigns the most. This statistic is not surprising considering how political overlap has been steadily shrinking between Democrats and Republicans. Having worsening opinions about the other party and shifting to more extreme political positions will naturally lead to less agreement between the two parties, as has been witnessed in the transition from the Trump to the Biden administration. President Biden issued more than thirty-six executive actions in his first week in office, and most of them were to reverse policies made by his predecessor. Such a difference in opinions is a clear indicator of how the political differences between the two major parties in the United States have been increasing.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/pew-photo.png\" alt=\"The Study by Pew Research Center\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nThe Study by Pew Research Center\n</p>\n<p>However, these growing differences in opinions might not just be because of growing hatred for the other party. These differences might also be deeply connected with political strategies adopted by both parties, as they both try to find voter bases that can help sway the election in their favor. The US has always had very close elections, so much so that it is sometimes called the ‘49 percent’ nation, referring to how each side has 49% of the votes, with the remaining 2% deciding the winner. In such close elections, each party must find a way to target as many people as possible. Over the past years, this has resulted in the party viewpoints diverging, with each party moving to more extreme positions to try and secure all of the votes in that particular region of the political spectrum. In such a system, any party trying to move back to the center will probably be vulnerable to attack from the other. A shift towards the center appears to be ‘soft’ in a politically polarized system, and this is a major factor in the two parties having little to no common ground in recent years. Being extreme has become a necessity to win elections.</p>\n<p>As the political dynamic changes and becomes more hard-lined, so does the voter base for each party. The Republican party has a large number of supporters who are white and feel that they are victims of the new social and cultural changes that have been taking place. Such voters fear that the ‘pure’ white America might be destroyed by the consolidation of other cultural groups such as African-Americans and Latinos in society. These communities form the voter base for the Democratic party. This division by culture happened in the 1960s during the Civil Rights movement, when white nationalists and supremacists started to join the Republican party and the Democratic party became the party associated with the civil rights movement. One of the most interesting changes in American politics is how the two parties have completely switched roles from the slavery and civil war era to the present. The Republican party was formed with the liberal view of opposing slavery, and with the leadership of Abraham Lincoln, it achieved this aim after the end of the Civil War. The Democratic party had consisted primarily of rich, white landowners from the South who advocated for the spread of slavery throughout the nation. In contrast, the Democratic party now has a liberal approach while the Republican party is highly conservative-minded.</p>\n<p>Political polarization also has a tendency to be associated with former President Trump, given his absolutist views on most topics. According to studies, a number of Republicans and Democrats developed more extremist views of political issues while the Trump administration was in office. This certainly makes sense when considering how Republicans had to start making decisions keeping their own political future in mind, which could be derailed if they disagreed with Trump. This obviously made them more likely to support more conservative policies which Trump advocated. In response, Democrats became even more liberal to try and counter what they see as a dangerous threat to the nation. Therefore, while it certainly is true that Trump’s presidential term exacerbated polarization in American politics, he is by no means the creator of this divisive political atmosphere, which has been forming gradually over the past decades as two major parties struggle to find the right mix of social, cultural and economic identity that can win elections in a country which is seemingly equally divided on every issue.</p>","id":"26ce44b8-133d-5887-9c33-50abc8abef09","fields":{"slug":"10-july-2021-political-polarization-in-the-united-states"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-07-10","title":"10 July 2021: Political Polarization in the United States","category":"Politics","tags":["Polarization","Politics","Democrats","Republicans"],"banner":"/assets/bg/politics-bg.jpg"},"timeToRead":4},{"excerpt":"Executive Summary Immigration is one of the many pressing foreign policy concerns that the United States has to deal with, but it is also drastically different from other problems in the same domain.

The three countries in Central America from which most immigrants originate are Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras, together known as the Northern Triangle. There are several long-term as well as short-term push factors which compel these immigrants to make the difficult journey across Mexico. Socioeconomic conditions are bad and have shown no signs of improvement in the last few decades, as land ownership and economic influence “remain concentrated in the hands of a small group of elites” (Congressional Research Service, 2021). As the working population of these countries continues to increase in size, immigration numbers are creeping up. The newer generations look for opportunities in the United States because job creation in their own countries continues to lag. Besides economic woes, violence is another long-term push factor in the Northern Triangle. Homicide rates have risen sharply since the start of the 21st century because the region has become the main pathway for drug smugglers into the United States. Consequently, the region is plagued with violence as gangs battle for control of local drug distribution and supremacy (Congressional Research Service, 2021). The violent altercations have displaced a large number of people, who eventually decide to leave their country when they have no way back to their homes.</p>\n<p>A major short-term factor is natural disasters. The region has been struggling with annual droughts which have consequently impacted crops and farmer income. Honduras was hit by two destructive hurricanes, Eta and Iota, in quick succession in November 2020. The government’s ineffective and insufficient response to these hurricanes and the other long-term issues afflicting their countries also convinced many people to migrate and has played a major role in the recent immigration waves. (Congressional Research Service, 2021)</p>\n<p>The U.S. policy on immigration also plays an important role. Before 1965, immigration to the U.S. was based on national quotas, to limit the number of people that could enter from each country. In 1965, this policy was changed to one based on uniting immigrant families in the U.S. and attracting skilled workers. This led to a shift in the major source of immigration, from Northwestern Europe to Asia and Latin America. Since then, immigration numbers have risen from around 320,000 immigrants per year in the 1960s to more than 1 million per year by 2000 (Center for Immigration Studies).</p>\n<h2 id=\"current-us-policy\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#current-us-policy\" aria-label=\"current us policy permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Current U.S. Policy</h2>\n<p>The majority of immigrants who legally enter the United States currently do so through family-based immigration, wherein the prospective migrant has a family member already living in the United States with citizenship, and in some cases, a green card. This family member sponsors the migrant, who is allowed into the U.S. after his application is reviewed and approved. A small number of immigrants also enter the countries through other pathways. One is refugee admissions, a process through which the U.S. allows refugees who are escaping persecution in their home countries. The United States places an upper limit on the number of refugees that can be admitted. For fiscal 2021, Former President Trump had placed this limit at 15,000, and President Biden has proposed raising this number to 62,500 (Pew Research Center, 2021). Another method for entry into the U.S. is employment-based green cards, which are awarded to foreign workers. Diversity visas, intended to diversify the population and awarded on a lottery basis, and H-1B visas for highly skilled workers, are the other primary legal pathways into the United States (Pew Research Center, 2021). For immigrants from Central America who might not be skilled workers and cannot apply for family-based immigration but still want to legally enter the US, the system is extremely ambiguous and confusing, to the point of being incoherent. This is because U.S. policies on immigration are not based on a single legislation; rather, they are the result of an iterative process of immigration legislation over many years, and as a result, they have become complicated and confusing over time. The legal pathways are very tightly constrained and in some cases, being skilled, knowing English, and having studied at a U.S. university might be considered less important than marrying a U.S. citizen. The arbitrariness of the immigration system has thus led a lot of immigrants to seek illegal entry into the United States (Hoover Institution et al., 2021).</p>\n<p>For immigrants who have already entered the United States, the asylum system is also ambiguous. A migrant seeking asylum goes through formal processes, but the system’s machinery often gets overwhelmed by demand and as a result, several immigrants do not get the chance to hear the verdict on their asylum appeal. Illegal immigrants have no clear path to amnesty; the U.S. government occasionally provides amnesties to very specific groups of people, but there is still a huge number of illegal immigrants who have no clear legal status (Hoover Institution et al., 2021).</p>\n<h2 id=\"analysis\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#analysis\" aria-label=\"analysis permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Analysis</h2>\n<p>Immigration is a complex issue, and the view that it is a burden for the U.S. to deal with is uninformed. It is critical to realize that immigration is actually a great strength for the U.S. on the global stage, and, if used in the best manner, can give the U.S. an advantage over its competitors. The immigrant demographic does not just consist of industrial workers, farmers, or laborers. There are all kinds of people among the immigrants, including skilled workers and professionals. This is mainly because the immigrants leave their country due to universal issues like drug violence, corruption, and ill-governance, rather than an issue that affects only one particular section of the Central American population. Therefore, immigrants also include skilled workers which the U.S. workforce can greatly benefit from. An important point to note here is that immigrants can easily become a natural part of the US, as it inherently has people from a large number of backgrounds and cultures. As a result, immigrants will not feel like foreigners, and within one to two generations, their families will integrate into American society. In this regard, the United States has an advantage over regions like Europe or Japan, which have faced issues in immigration and increasing the presence of foreign professionals as these regions have a single, dominant, cultural background (George W. Bush Institute &#x26; Rice, 2021). By attracting skilled workers from the countries in Central America, the U.S. can benefit economically while also giving immigrants an opportunity for a better life. An important example to note is Fiji, a country which non-native South Asians became eager to leave after a major coup. The instability led to these South Asians searching for alternative places to reside in, and as a result, they began to strategically improve their education and skills to climb the ladder on the skill-based immigration policies of countries like Australia and New Zealand. Until then, natives and non-native South Asians had had the same education levels; however, after the coup, the South Asians began to gain skills to successfully immigrate. Therefore, skills-based immigration benefits both the country receiving immigrants and the immigrants themselves (Hoover Institution et al., 2021).</p>\n<p>Current U.S. policy does not address different groups of immigrants in an efficient manner, which results in confusion, ambiguity, and a lack of control over the system. The United States should address the immigrant issue by dividing the immigrants into three distinct groups: the illegal immigrants already present in the US, the immigrants waiting at the border and those about to cross into the US, and those who have not yet started the journey to the U.S. but may become potential immigrants in the future. Solving the issue for the first two groups requires a short-term solution while solving the issue for the third group is more of a long-term solution focusing on the root causes and push factors persisting in Central America. The short-term solution needs to include amnesty for the illegal immigrants present in the U.S. and also involve cooperation with Mexico to use it as a buffer region to contain and stop most of the illegal immigrants. The long-term solution involves cooperation with the Central American countries to help them solve the issues there. This is exactly what is lacking in current and previous U.S. policy; it does not cooperate with Mexico to a sufficient degree, and also does not focus on helping the Northern Triangle countries. As a result, both the short-term and long-term problems continue to trouble the United States.</p>\n<p>Current U.S. policy on legal immigration is also unsatisfactory. The primary pathway is through family sponsorship. A major problem with family sponsorship is the sheer volume of applications that the U.S. receives. A large number of applicants often have to wait for years to receive a green card because of a per-country quota which restricts the number of green cards that a particular country’s citizens receive to no more than 7% of the total green cards issued (Pew Research Center, 2021). Another issue is the potential entry of individuals who are unable to financially support themselves, which places a burden on American resources while offering little to the U.S. in return. In addition, restricting the main category of immigration to family-based immigration is a major problem, as the preexisting presence of an individual who will harm rather than contribute to society can lead to the entry of more such individuals.\nLastly, the United States’ approach to amnesty is haphazard; some illegal immigrants receive amnesty while others do not, and this process is arbitrary. In addition, a large number of immigrants neither receive amnesty nor get deported, leaving them without any legal rights, a status contradictory to the democratic nature of the U.S. The main argument against amnesty for all immigrants is that it essentially incentivizes illegal immigration, but the best solution for this problem is providing amnesty for current illegal immigrants and using resolute enforcement in the future, by coordinating with the Latin American countries and Mexico as described earlier. The only way to deal with illegal immigration is to improve border enforcement and cooperation with Mexican authorities to ensure that most illegal immigrants are stopped in Mexico before they can reach the border.</p>\n<h2 id=\"opinion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#opinion\" aria-label=\"opinion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Opinion</h2>\n<p>Current U.S. policy on immigration is unsatisfactory in several departments, including the legal path into the United States, amnesty for illegal immigrants present in the U.S., and in terms of addressing the short-term and long-term push factors to stop large-scale immigration in the future. The Biden administration has undoubtedly taken some much-needed decisions on immigration in the past few months to reduce the negative impact that the Trump administration had; however, there are still several ways to improve the current U.S. policies while keeping the United States’ benefit in mind.</p>\n<p>As far as the legal path into the United States is concerned, family-based immigration should predominantly be replaced by skill-based immigration. This change will give the U.S. assured economic benefit as it admits people by giving skilled professionals higher priority, and it gives these professionals an ideal atmosphere to best utilize their skills as well. It is important to note that an ideal policy would not remove family-based immigration entirely; it would still be important to continue family-based immigration in terms of reuniting families who are separated. However, family-based immigration would be given less priority. In addition, family-based immigration would include prioritization based on immigrants’ skills to allow them to climb up the ladder. This further ensures economic return for the United States and does not place a burden on its resources. Skill-based immigration is especially important and beneficial if the United States continues to place a limit on immigration, as it has been doing. Another major benefit of skill-based immigration and family-based immigration running simultaneously is it would get bipartisan support; Republicans are likely to support skill-based immigration because of its economic benefits while Democrats will want to continue family-based immigration for reunification purposes, making it easier for Congress to pass legislation on immigration.</p>\n<p>Amnesty for illegal immigrants already present in the U.S. is also an important part of U.S. policy that should be improved. Such illegal immigrants should be fined and then given amnesty as long as they have not committed any serious crimes, in which case there should be further investigation and deportation if necessary. To avoid amnesty becoming an incentive for illegal immigration, the United States must ensure resolute enforcement in the future, both domestically and in Mexico and Latin America. Enforcement in Mexico and Latin America falls under addressing the short-term and long-term factors of Central American immigration. Enforcement, systemic reform, and amnesty must follow a particular order to ensure the maximum positive impact. Firstly, the system should be reformed around skills-based immigration as described above. Then, the illegal immigrants present in the United States should be given amnesty, which should be followed by resolute border enforcement in collaboration with Mexico.</p>\n<p>Addressing the short-term and long-term immigration factors requires efficient coordination with Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries. The United States must negotiate with Mexico to make sure that it stops and contains most of the illegal immigrants that come. This strategy uses Mexico as a buffer region, which minimizes the migrant flow that the U.S. has to deal with. The U.S. must also help Mexico establish holding facilities in Mexico for individuals who wish to seek asylum lawfully. Creating similar facilities in the United States will ensure the U.S. can comfortably deal with these immigrants. They will be transferred from the Mexican facilities to the American facilities as each immigrant is dealt with and either allowed entry or deported if it is necessary (CBS, 2021). The United States should additionally negotiate with Mexico to ensure that Mexico strictly regulates its southern border and detains any person or groups which intend to cross into the U.S. illegally. Lastly, the United States must hold dialogue with the Northern Triangle countries to decide the best method to solve their longstanding issues, through direct intervention, aid, or some other method. If these countries resist change due to systemic corruption, the U.S. must directly intervene to remove the drug cartels and corruption and once again establish peace in the region, preferably with the United Nations’ support.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bibliography\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#bibliography\" aria-label=\"bibliography permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Bibliography</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>CBS (Director).

China’s foreign policy is perhaps one of the most intricate and carefully planned in the world today; consequently, it also gives a good idea of what China is aiming to achieve in the decades to come, the countries its vision includes as potential allies, and those it sees as a threat.</p>\n<p>Over the past several years, there have been multiple indications, directly from Chinese leaders and indirectly from their foreign policy decisions, that the country is actively pursuing a position at the top of the global hierarchy. History always provides a suitable lens to study the present; likewise, a look at Chinese history is necessary to fully understand the reasons and motivations behind current Chinese decisions.</p>\n<p>The period from 1839-1949 is often called China’s “Century of Humiliation,” as the Chinese empire was overpowered by Western powers like Britain and France, as well as Russia and Japan. This subjugation experienced by the Chinese empire is regarded as a defeat to be extremely ashamed of in China. It started in 1839 with the First Opium War against Britain when China tried to put an end to the illegal opium trade being carried out by the British since addiction to the drug was having a widespread impact on society. China lost this war badly, and the Second Opium War, in which France fought with Britain, had the same result. Subsequently, China lost a number of wars, especially against Japan, and the rulers also had to sign several treaties after each loss, giving away valuable territory; Britain additionally made China increase the number of ports that allowed British traders in an effort to increase British influence and trade in the region.</p>\n<p>These continuous losses finally led to the formation of the modern state of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Since then, the nation’s ambitions have been rising steeply. In a 2017 speech at the Party Congress, President Xi Jinping pledged to achieve the “Great Rejuvenation” of the country by 2049, the one-hundredth anniversary of the nation. The phrase is not new; Xi has been using this phrase to refer to sustainable yet accelerated development and a return to great heights since 2012. However, his 2017 speech provided more specificity and offered a multistage plan to achieve rejuvenation in a gradual manner across three time periods: 2020, 2035, and 2050. An important and especially relevant example his speech included was the military. Xi explained that the military would achieve mechanization by 2020, modernization by 2035, and would become a “world-class” military by 2050. Evidence of China’s intention to continue forward with this plan can be found in China’s 14th Five-Year Plan for 2021-2025. It envisions that China’s military will be fully “mechanized and informationized” by 2027.</p>\n<p>The 2017 speech also provides information about China’s plan on the global level. Xi stated that China would focus on “global combat capabilities” and that China would “move closer to the center of the world.” The President was also optimistic about China’s progression towards the role of global hegemon that it is actively pursuing; he stated that the level of multipolarity in world order was “rapidly accelerating,” implying that he thinks Chinese influence is increasing rapidly.</p>\n<p>To find more concrete signs of increasing Chinese influence in the world, one need not look farther than the principal global organization: The United Nations. Beijing has slowly started taking steps to replace the US from the leadership role in the UN - they have increased funding by more than five times even as the US stopped funding, and the number of Chinese personnel in the UN is also increasing at a significant rate. More than 25% of UN Specialized Agencies are now headed by Chinese nationals. China has also tried to introduce the notion of each country having its own human rights standards, with many labeling this as an attempt to popularize authoritarian rule. The United States would surely find these signs alarming. China is trying to replace and reduce US influence in any and all ways possible. These are further signs that the US might soon find itself in a much less promising position, with the exact opposite being true for China.</p>\n<p>Another example of Chinese strategy is its relations with other countries. China had a considerably tense relationship with North Korea not so long ago, with Beijing being concerned about North Korea’s growing nuclear capabilities. However, in what is another sign of calculated decision-making, China has revitalized its partnership with North Korea in recent times. While China still has concerns about North Korea’s nuclear prowess, it has now accepted this reality and is actively working to increase its influence in Asia in any way possible. China sees the lack of progress in US-North Korea talks as an opportunity to exert its own influence in the region while reducing American influence at the same time. Therefore, the Chinese strategy on the issue of North Korea has far-reaching implications for foreign policy and politics.</p>\n<p>China also abandoned its policy of neutrality in the conflict-ridden Middle-Eastern region in 2016. Realizing that the US has a strained relationship with both Iran and Saudi Arabia and that Russia will continue to remain neutral, China has seen economic opportunities and inserted itself into the conflict between the Middle Eastern countries. The region has a considerable portion of Earth’s conventional oil reserves and China’s manufacturing-focused economy’s need for resources like oil will only continue to rise.</p>\n<p>Finally, China has also sought to increase its influence across a large number of countries in regions like Eurasia, South Asia, Africa, and the Middle-East through its highly controversial Belt and Road Initiative(BRI). This initiative essentially involves China investing large amounts of money to build infrastructure for increased transportation and travel capabilities between these regions. The main motivation behind this initiative lies in finding new markets for Chinese commodities in order to provide a boost to the slowing Chinese economy. BRI is controversial because several Western countries and experts have claimed that the initiative is an attempt to make comparatively smaller economies fall into a debt-trap to gain strategic advantages for China. Once such countries fall into a debt-trap and cannot pay back, they are allegedly pressured by China to support its political and geo-strategic interests. For instance, Tajikistan fell into debt and had to cede about 1158 square kilometers of territory to China; the country still owes $1.2 billion to China. Former Tanzanian President John Magufuli called BRI deals “exploitative,” explaining that Beijing wanted Tanzania to give China guarantees and a 99 years lease on a port construction. Countries at risk of falling into debt trap include Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, and many other South Asian nations.</p>\n<p>This is by no means a complete list of strategic Chinese decisions. Other steps taken by China include regional assertion, such as military aggression against India and the continued crackdown on Hong Kong. It is safe to conclude that China is aiming for and beyond the stars its flag also embodies; it is making every effort to have more than one reason to celebrate its hundred-year anniversary in 2049. While not necessarily alarming, China’s progress will certainly result in a wave of implications and consequences across the globe.</p>","id":"e566769d-8bc9-5c34-9e9e-f5d20b7fdd15","fields":{"slug":"15-april-2021-china-a-country-reaching-for-the-stars"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-04-15","title":"15 April 2021 China: A Country Reaching For The Stars","category":"Politics","tags":["China","Politics","Development"],"banner":"/assets/bg/politics-bg.jpg"},"timeToRead":5},{"excerpt":"In September 1962, the CIA prepared a Special National Intelligence Estimate (SNIE) on “The Military Buildup in Cuba” after U-2 plane missions flown over Cuba found that surface-to-air missiles were arriving in the Caribbean country from the Soviet…","html":"<p>In September 1962, the CIA prepared a Special National Intelligence Estimate (SNIE) on “The Military Buildup in Cuba” after U-2 plane missions flown over Cuba found that surface-to-air missiles were arriving in the Caribbean country from the Soviet Union. Images collected in October 1962 confirmed the worst fears of the USA and brought the world to the brink of nuclear war. At the same time, another conflict with huge implications was taking shape in the Himalayas. On October 20 1962, Mao Zedong’s Red China attacked India on its western and northeast borders in two different but simultaneous strikes a thousand kilometres apart. As John F. Kennedy and his Cabinet dealt with the Cuban Missile Crisis, the President, with the support of his extremely competent Indian ambassador John Kenneth Galbraith, handled the equally dangerous Sino-Indian conflict, the titular event in JFK’s Forgotten Crisis by Bruce Riedel.</p>\n<p>JFK’s Forgotten Crisis seeks to provide insight into and give credit for JFK’s pivotal role in the Sino-Indian tensions, which had been largely ignored until the writing of this book. Riedel focuses on the incredibly delicate position JFK was in during the peak of both crises; the back cover of the book describes the time as “the most dangerous days of the entire cold war”. The Cuban Missile crisis has been extensively written about from various perspectives. While the 1962 Sino-Indian war has since been analysed by Indians in an effort to understand what resulted in such a humiliating defeat for them, Americans have forgotten what their own President did to defuse this international conflict. The critical contribution of Riedel’s book lies in this very fact. It demonstrates how JFK simultaneously managed two international conflicts, and how he managed them exceedingly well\n.\nThe book touches on several important themes relating to the time period between the 1950’s and the 1970’s. Examining these in detail is essential to developing an in-depth understanding of Riedel’s novel. One of the recurring points in the book is foreign relations between the US, and India and Pakistan, as well as the changes in these relationships with time. Riedel spends a significant amount of time analysing the relationships between the American and Indian leaders and describes how these relationships played an important role in defusing Sino-Indian tensions. A special mention is given to Nehru’s 1956 visit to Eisenhower’s Gettysburg farm where the two leaders spent fourteen hours talking about various issues. In an accurate summary of US-India relations during the 1950s, the author notes that “the two did not come to agreement on all issues or even most, but Eisenhower concluded that he “liked Prime Minister Nehru”.” (Riedel, 10) An important point in the context of the Sino-Indian war is that Eisenhower and Nehru had very different views on China. Nehru, a prominent leader of the Non-Alignment Movement (NAM) which began amid the Cold War, wanted to maintain amicable relations with its communist neighbor and even requested Eisenhower to grant China a permanent seat in the United Nations Security Council. Eisenhower refused to consider it with China’s role in the Korean war being “fresh in his memory.” (Riedel, 10) The transition from Eisenhower to Kennedy also saw a gradual but definite shift in the US stance in South-East Asia. This became evident when the US started to back India publicly in October 1962 on its border dispute with China and started to provide arms to support India’s military against the strong Chinese forces. The policy shift towards India is further corroborated by the fact that Kennedy provided arms for India despite explicitly promising Ayub Khan, Pakistan’s military dictator, in 1961 that he would not do so without consulting Pakistan first.</p>\n<p>The author writes extensively about John Kenneth Galbraith and his pivotal role in the Sino-Indian crisis. He ends the book by saying the world was fortunate to have JFK and Galbraith in those testing times and, judging by Galbraith’s contribution, this is not an exaggeration. He describes how Kennedy and Galbraith had a very close relationship; Kennedy even offered personally intervening and getting him an exemption from Harvard when Galbraith had to go back and resume his teaching duties. Riedel also mentions how Galbraith said in his diary that Washington was “totally occupied with Cuba” (Riedel, 119) at the peak of the Sino-Indian war. Galbraith did not receive any significant communication or advice with regards to the escalating tensions on the North-East border. Riedel observes that this was probably for the best. Galbraith was extremely well informed, had good intuition and relied on himself to take critical decisions. He notes, “During this period Galbraith did receive one message from the State Department, but characteristically chose to challenge it.” (Riedel, 120) Kennedy trusted Galbraith, and his trust was not misplaced. Galbraith handled the crisis extremely well. While Kennedy and Washington defused the Cuban tensions, he let Galbraith handle the other big conflict. Riedel says, “It is clear that Kennedy felt that Galbraith and he made up the right team to tackle the war in India largely on their own.” (Riedel, 117) It is worthwhile to note that Galbraith had an amicable relationship with Jawaharlal Nehru as well, and he gradually became an important advisor to Nehru especially in matters related to Chinese aggression. JFK’s Forgotten Crisis thus duly gives credit to another figure largely ignored by American history and literature: John Kenneth Galbraith. Along with Kennedy, he established good relations with India which would surely have led to a concrete partnership in the longer term, but for Kennedy’s sudden assassination.</p>\n<p>Continuing with the theme of American-Indian relations, Riedel describes how American relations with India looked set to continue improving under Kennedy after positive initial exchanges. On November 19, 1962, when Sino-Indian tensions were at their highest and India’s situation was growing desperate, Nehru wrote two letters to Kennedy asking for extensive military assistance from the US to avoid Chinese occupation of the entire North-East Frontier Agency (NEFA). On the same day, Kennedy decided to send Ambassador Averell Harriman to India to understand India’s military requirements. Fortunately for India, Chinese leader Mao announced a unilateral ceasefire the next day, implicitly forcing Nehru to accept it due to India’s dire situation, and thus ending the war as it had begun: on China’s terms. The ceasefire gave Harriman’s mission time to assess India’s military needs without having to respond immediately. Harriman and his team had three primary objectives. The first one was increasing US military aid to India. In 1963, The United States and the UK facilitated the training of American, British, Australian, and Canadian pilots in India with bombers and jet fighters. The US and the UK also provided arms for mountain divisions of the Indian Army. Additionally, Kennedy agreed to a $500 million military package for India over five years.\nHarriman’s second goal involved initiating India-Pakistan negotiations on the Kashmir dispute. In a rare instance of Kennedy ignoring his Indian ambassador Galbraith’s advice, JFK tried to pursue a peaceful settlement. Negotiations did not go well, and Pakistan’s simultaneous and separate border deal with China - which involved Pakistan giving territory which allegedly belonged to India, to China - “symbolized Pakistan’s new entente with Communist China, the enemy of America and India.” (Riedel, 155-156) Kennedy’s attempt to settle the Kashmir issue instead led to the atrophying of his relations with the Pakistani leaders, including Ayub Khan and his foreign minister Zulfikar Bhutto.\nThe third and final objective Harriman had was to secure Indian support for the covert missions CIA had been carrying out in Tibet since Eisenhower. The CIA was secretly supporting a Tibetan rebellion against China. An elaborate operation had been created over time, which included training Tibetan rebels in Colorado and then parachuting them into Tibet from East Pakistan air bases. As Kennedy’s relations with Pakistan soured - with Ayub Khan persistently threatening to shut down the Tibet operation if the US tilt towards India did not stop - Washington decided to get India’s support for the mission instead. After a series of discussions with the CIA’s Near East (NE) division, India’s head of the Intelligence Bureau (IB), B.N. Mullik agreed to support the Tibetan rebellion. India started to help the Colorado trainees in infiltrating the Line of Actual Control (LOAC) and getting into Tibet. India also helped in training Tibetans who started patrolling along the LOAC and collecting intelligence on the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA).</p>\n<p>Despite all this cooperation, India and the United States failed to capitalize on the improvements in their relations and cement a strategic alliance. Nehru was disappointed with the military aid package, as was Kenneth Galbraith. When Nehru requested aid worth $1.3 billion, Kennedy was only able to promise less than half of that value. After Kennedy’s assassination, the military aid package was suspended under Lyndon Johnson and remained so for several months before a meeting was scheduled to take a final decision in May 1964. Unfortunately, a day before the meeting, Nehru suddenly died. Nehru’s successor Lal Bahadur Shastri was “eager to close an arms deal,” (Riedel, 163) and when the Soviets made a multiyear military aid offer, India accepted it in what was a “lost opportunity in Indo-American relations”. (Riedel, 163) Thus, one of the key points of JFK’s Forgotten Crisis is Indian-American relations, and how the “unforeseeable events” (Riedel, 163) of Kennedy’s assassination and Nehru’s death “stymied Kennedy’s goal of building a new long-term strategic partnership with India.” (Riedel, 163) Riedel argues that India and the United States would have enjoyed a considerably closer alliance today if JFK had continued to be President.</p>\n<p>Another critical aspect Riedel analyses in great detail is the evolution of US Intelligence and its essential role in the Korean War, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the Tibetan resistance and the Sino-Indian war. In October 1950, Mao sent a massive number of troops to assist North Korea in the Korean War and ward off the advancing American and South Korean forces. In a fatal move, General Douglas MacArthur - the man in charge of the American troops - had prohibited any outside intelligence (including the CIA) from interfering in his decisions. He had his own intelligence set up in Tokyo, and this intelligence centre continuously downplayed the threat of the Chinese forces in wait for the advancing US troops. The estimate Tokyo provided on the number of Chinese troops in Korea was less than one-tenth of the actual number. MacArthur had also assured President Truman and said that China would not be able to mount a realistic attack on his forces. When the two armies did meet, MacArthur’s and South Korea’s forces were destroyed. As a result of this grave intelligence blunder, the CIA was brought in and it became the irreplaceable intelligence agency for the US. Riedel describes how India had tried to warn Washington about the advancing Chinese forces only to be ignored and uses this incident as a starting point to extensively examine Indo-American relations. He also states that the Korean War played a large part in convincing the American public that China was “a crazy communist state.” (Riedel, 20)</p>\n<p>Riedel focuses on clandestine CIA operations, especially the rebellion in Tibet, to a great extent. In 1957, Allen Dulles, the Director of the CIA, launched a Tibetan rebellion with Pakistan’s help which involved training Tibetan rebels to resist military aggression from China and to protect their homeland, as described earlier on Page 3. The author correctly argues that this CIA operation had big consequences which still exist in Asian politics today. He has described how Ayub Khan used the CIA operations as a trump card, and repeatedly threatened to shut them down if the US continued to side with India. The biggest consequence, however, was the Chinese invasion of India in 1962. He argues that Mao was paranoid about an India-US alliance and thought that it was this partnership which was fuelling the Tibetan rebellion. Mao wrongly thought that instead of Pakistan, it was India who was secretly helping the CIA and the Tibetan rebels. Riedel observes, “It is, of course, deeply ironic that the Chinese invasion of India prompted close American-Indian intelligence cooperation, because in part Mao's paranoia about American-Indian collusion in Tibet prompted the invasion.” (Riedel, 160) The Chinese invasion also led to Pakistan allying with China as Kennedy continued to support India while trying to keep the Pakistan operations going. The other covert operation that the CIA was carrying out with the help of Pakistan and which is mentioned briefly in the book involved flying U-2 spy planes over the Soviet Union to collect intelligence about the communist state. This mission experienced a severe setback in 1960 when the Soviets shot down a U-2 aircraft and exposed the US operations to the world; the CIA subsequently stopped these reconnaissance flights after Eisenhower told the agency “it was too dangerous.” (Riedel, 41) The CIA continued its Tibet operation, however; it lasted throughout Kennedy’s presidency until it morphed into the agreement with India described on Page 4 even as Pakistan shifted its support from the United States to Communist China.</p>\n<p>Riedel also analyses Pakistan’s foreign policies and decisions with great detail, which is only natural considering how important a role the country played in the Sino-Indian war and the conflicts India was dealing with at the time. He describes Pakistan as “eager to find a foreign protector” (Riedel, 28-29); he strongly suggests the country entered into two military alliances (CENTO and SEATO) with the US primarily to achieve this objective. He says, “By the mid-1950s, Pakistanis could claim to be America’s most allied ally.” (Riedel, 29) He also explicitly observes that “Pakistan had allied itself with the United States in the SEATO and CENTO alliances to strengthen its armed forces to fight India, not Russia or China.” (Riedel, 128) As mentioned earlier, Ayub Khan was increasingly upset about the American support for India and repeatedly tried to threaten the CIA that he would shut down their secret Tibet operations. One of the reasons the Pakistani leader slowly drifted towards China and away from the US was the Kashmir dispute; he desperately wanted Kashmir to be a part of his country. He even tried to create an exchange offer during the Sino-Indian war when he proposed that Pakistan would maintain a ceasefire on India’s western boundaries if India gave up Kashmir. He pressed Kennedy to make this offer an integral part of any Indo-Pakistan negotiations. Riedel gives immense credit to Galbraith here, who correctly advised Kennedy that Nehru would never consider this offer; as a result of this, Kennedy never considered Khan’s proposal and made no promises about Kashmir. Ayub Khan’s attempt to capitalize on China’s aggression failed.</p>\n<p>This brings us to another key point in the book: Communist China. In what is otherwise a very neutral narration and analysis, Riedel gives credit to Mao for his brilliant strategy in winning its 1962 border war. He quotes a CIA report, saying that “China played on Nehru's Asian, anti-imperialist mental attitude; his proclivity to temporize, and his sincere desire for an amicable Sino-Indian relationship.” (Riedel, 26) This strategy used by China was a masterpiece; the country avoided making explicit border statements which would be controversial but did not retract any of its previous claims either. Riedel spends considerable time scrutinizing Prospects of Communist China, a National Intelligence Estimate (NIE) delivered by the CIA in May 1962. He notes how the report described the economic slowdown China had experienced due to Mao’s aggressive policy known as “Great Leap Forward.” He also analyses the Soviet-China fallout at this point in the book. The two communist giants had disagreed on how to fight the cold war; and “virtually all Soviet technicians and advisers, both in economic and military aid projects, had departed suddenly.” (Riedel, 84) Riedel describes on several occasions how Mao spared no effort in occupying Tibet, and how he committed a huge number of troops to crush the Tibetan rebellion being sponsored by the CIA. Riedel quotes the CIA’s Tibet Task Force chief, saying “Mao refused to let bands of unruly border tribesmen deny him his dream of reuniting the greater Han empire.” (Riedel, 86)</p>\n<p>The author thus uses these themes to narrate the Sino-Indian war. JFK’s Forgotten Crisis essentially seeks to tell the story of a largely ignored political crisis and bring its events to light. Riedel himself writes, “Kennedy’s critical role in the Sino-Indian War of 1962 has also been largely ignored. This book seeks to fill that lacuna.” (Riedel, 3) This was clearly his primary objective: to grab the attention of the American public and educate them about this important world event. From this historical aspect, Riedel succeeds spectacularly. He provides an immensely elaborate description of events leading up to the Sino-Indian tensions, the war itself and the aftermath. Towards the end, he uses descriptions of the Indo-Pakistani War of 1965 which saw active Pakistani-Chinese cooperation, and the 1971 war which led to the creation of Bangladesh, to transition into modern Asian politics and its relation with the 1962 war. Thus, he covers every event punctiliously and paints a clear picture for every kind of reader, whether it is a fellow diplomat or a complete beginner in foreign policy. Considering that he aimed to educate the general public about the Sino-Indian war and the policy decisions behind it, he has done an excellent job in making this book a simple yet diligent study.</p>\n<p>JFK’s Forgotten Crisis is also an intricate study of foreign policy. Riedel examines Communist China, its decisions and the reasons behind these decisions. He devotes an entire section to analyse why the Chinese withdrew from NEFA and retreated behind the McMahon Line (the border drawn by the British). He looks at China and its ambitions from Mao’s perspective and consequently develops sound, well-thought-out conclusions. He describes how Mao’s primary objective was to humiliate Nehru and India and to prove that communism was the superior system in “the contest for Asia between the People’s Republic of China and democratic India.” (Riedel, 142) By routing India’s inferior army in NEFA, Riedel points out, Mao had achieved his aim. He argues that by retreating and declaring a ceasefire, Mao achieved gains in the present and for the future. He says that Mao demonstrated “restraint” (Riedel, 142) by retreating, and supports this with evidence, saying,  “China would later point to its restraint in November 1962 as a sign that it was a responsible member of the international community and should be given its seat in the UN Security Council.” (Riedel, 142) He notes that in addition to logistical issues, Mao must also have known that further aggression and an attempt to occupy all of North-East India “would have forced Kennedy’s hand.” (Riedel, 142) Riedel describes the US and UK military assistance that India received in detail and thus helps the reader envision the strong message that this aid sent to China, and Mao’s subsequent reluctance to continue the military aggression.</p>\n<p>The book is heavily based on decision making. Through several examples, Riedel slowly helps the reader to build an accurate impression of how decisions are taken in different types of administrations and also notes how costly conflicts and misunderstandings within administrations can be. He uses the Bay of Pigs fiasco to describe the latter. He describes how Kennedy was certain about not using the Marines and the Navy as a backup for the planned invasion, and how the CIA did not believe he was serious about reducing American involvement. He writes, “Thus there was a complete policy disconnect between the White House and the CIA on the plan: Kennedy thought he was supporting an operation that was plausibly deniable if it went wrong, whereas Dulles was convinced his plan would be backed up by the U.S. military if anything went amiss. This fundamental difference between the policymaker and the covert operator doomed the mission.” (Riedel, 53)</p>\n<p>Riedel devotes an entire chapter to Galbraith and additionally talks about his role in the other ones, a testament to Galbraith’s importance in the 1962 war, and in Indian affairs from an American perspective in general. He narrates Galbraith’s increasing influence in Kennedy and Nehru’s decision making and describes the ambassador as a straightforward, efficient and responsible diplomat. He gives several examples to demonstrate how Galbraith knew exactly how Nehru would respond to any situation and was able to accordingly send suitable advice to Washington and Kennedy. Thus, Riedel succeeds in providing an excellent insight into diplomacy as well.</p>\n<p>Lastly, Riedel aims to study leadership. He extensively covers Kennedy’s presidency and analyses decisions made by him; when they were correct, he gives the reasons Kennedy took this decision, and when they were wrong, he narrates and examines what led to an incorrect decision. He feels it is important to study Kennedy’s leadership because in his opinion, “How Kennedy managed two crises on opposite sides of the globe holds lessons for decisionmakers today.” (Riedel, 5) Riedel closes his book by stating the important lessons learnt from Kennedy’s presidency. The first lesson, he says, is about carefully and personally picking their top intelligence officials from among their trusted aides. He says, “ “The truth will set you free” should be more than a motto: It must be continually put into action.” (Riedel, 177) He emphasizes the importance of intelligence officials who will prefer telling bad news as opposed to telling the President what they want to hear. Riedel earlier corroborates this by stating the example of the intelligence fiasco in the Korean War, and Kennedy’s mistake in the Bay of Pigs disaster. Another important lesson, according to him, is that Presidents must do all they can to make covert partnerships effective, like JFK appeased the upset Ayub Khan with a dinner at Mount Vernon in May 1961, resulting in the resumption of CIA’s clandestine Tibet operations. Riedel ends by praising Kennedy’s decision to not go to war in Cuba despite his experts telling him to, and also lauds Kennedy’s wisdom in trusting Galbraith and giving him the authority to handle the Sino-Indian crisis.</p>\n<p>Riedel additionally examines Nehru and his leadership in the book. He credibly observes how many of Nehru’s decisions were based on his domestic political position. He keeps in mind that Nehru was fixated on remaining neutral in the cold war and that he wanted India to be self-sufficient. This allows him to understand as well as explain why Nehru seemed to be mentally exhausted towards the end of the Sino-Indian crisis: relying on the US was strictly against his principles; he “had fought for independence for so long from the West.” (Riedel, 128) Accepting Western support hurt Nehru’s pride.</p>\n<p>JFK’s Forgotten Crisis has a few missing elements, but despite this, Riedel has done an outstanding job. He himself avers that the book would have been much more complete if it had included references to Chinese official documents and their analysis. It is not the author’s fault that China does not release any policy documents, and he has done a marvellous job despite missing the official version of the story of one of the two main countries in the crisis. Likewise, the book could have included more inputs from the Indian side. Riedel does quote several works by Indians, including John P. Dalvi’s Himalayan Blunder and B.N. Mullik’s The Chinese Betrayal, but interviewing more people close to Nehru and more importantly, people who have a more neutral view would have resulted in a wider and more complete narration. It is important to note that both Mullik and Dalvi were personally involved in the crisis: Mullik was the head of the IB while Dalvi was in charge of the Fourth Division of the Army protecting the North-East border.\nIt is difficult to judge Riedel’s book given that it is arguably the first work which neutrally covers the Sino-Indian crisis. Regardless of this lack of precedent, it is fair to say the author has done a brilliant job to tell this extremely important story from four different perspectives: the US and the CIA, Pakistan, India and China. His work fills an important void in American foreign policy literature; as The Wall Street Journal said, “The greatest value in JFK’s Forgotten Crisis is the compelling answers it provides.” (Riedel, back cover)</p>\n<h2 id=\"bibliography\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#bibliography\" aria-label=\"bibliography permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Bibliography</h2>\n<p>Riedel, Bruce. <em>JFK's Forgotten Crisis: Tibet, the CIA, and the Sino-Indian War.</em> Brookings Institution Press, 2015.</p>","id":"09a3c426-17d1-5905-b15d-f45d56b265af","fields":{"slug":"15-february-2021-a-review-of-jf-ks-forgotten-crisis-by-bruce-riedel"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-02-15","title":"15 February 2021: A Review of JFK's Forgotten Crisis by Bruce Riedel","category":"Politics","tags":["Foreign Policy","Politics","South East Asia"],"banner":"/assets/bg/politics-bg.jpg"},"timeToRead":16},{"excerpt":"TOn January 6, 2021, a mob of pro-Trump rioters overwhelmed security at the US Capitol and stormed the building even as the election results were being certified.

They disrupted proceedings and the members of Congress had to be rushed out in an emergency evacuation. The shocking event resulted in the death of four rioters and Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who succumbed to his injuries overnight.</p>\n<p>The mob started going to towards the Capitol after Donald Trump’s rally, which is largely being seen as the catalyst for the violent reaction of his supporters. In his address to the gathering, Trump reiterated what he has already said numerous times: the election was rigged. His speech included sentences like “We will never concede. You don’t concede when there’s theft involved.” He also stated, multiple times, that they would “go to the Capitol”, which emboldened the supporters and further fanned the flame. After this, they started marching towards Capitol Hill, even as security vehicles tried to catch up with the angry mob and stop them from reaching the Capitol.</p>\n<p>The events which unfolded after this are common knowledge. The fact of the matter is, this should never even have happened. Trump should not have agitated the protestors in the first place, but even more shocking was his reluctance to put out a video on his infamous Twitter handle condemning the violence. He finally agreed to do so, but convincing him should not have been difficult. In fact, he should not have even needed convincing. A President should be capable enough to recognise a violent situation.</p>\n<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, that video was followed by a tweet calling his supporters ‘great patriots’ and telling them that they will ‘remember this day forever’. Twitter flagged the tweet, and has subsequently suspended him permanently from the platform.</p>\n<p>After the Electoral College certified his victory, President-elect Joe Biden said that those who were part of the mob cannot be called protestors, but should be labelled as ‘domestic terrorists’. He also called Trump a President ‘who has made his contempt for our democracy, our constitution and the rule of law clear in everything he has done’.</p>\n<p>Trump has repeatedly denied the election results and refused to accept his defeat, but to actually incite a breach of the Capitol to interrupt election certification proceedings was unprecedented. Not anymore, though. The situation is so fragile that Senators are actually worried about what havoc Trump might cause in the last 2 weeks of his term. An impeachment is being contemplated. There is a growing call for Mike Pence to invoke the 25th Amendment and to remove Trump from office immediately, with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi supporting both options. Suffice to say, one of the world’s most prominent democracies shouldn’t be worrying about what violence their President might cause in the last few days he is in office. The very fact that this is happening is disturbing.</p>\n<p> A move for an impeachment would be more symbolic than realistic, since there isn’t enough time for a Senate trial. An increasing number of Senators are willing to take any route to remove Trump before his term ends, and if not remove him, proceed with the impeachment in order to follow up with the consequences of his actions. Trump should get what he deserves for the violence he caused, in any way possible.</p>\n<p>The efforts of Mike Pence and the other Republicans who eventually certified the results in the Electoral College should be appreciated, but the fact remains that it shouldn’t have taken so much violence for them to take the reasonable (and fairly obvious) decision. Pence, especially, was in a very delicate position when Trump falsely tweeted that the Vice President has the power to reject fraudulent voters. He was increasingly pressured by Trump to defy the constitution and not certify Biden’s victory, even though he has absolutely no power to do so. Pence did eventually acknowledge that he did not have the right to overturn the election in a letter to the members of Congress, in a rare instance of him going against Trump. He has largely remained loyal to the President and spent the last four years defending him and his decisions. What is most important, however, is that Pence did the right thing this time. If Pence had been as adamant as Trump and failed to see reason, something even worse and catastrophic might have happened.</p>\n<p>In the end, what has happened cannot be undone. The US Capitol was breached for the first time since the 1814 Burning of Washington, more than 200 years ago. That incident was caused by the British, not a protest incited by the sitting President. Trump has certainly made things much harder for Biden, as the US continues to lose respect on the international domain. The country has been weakened from within, and with America’s closest allies not remaining as close any longer, Biden might have not one but two big challenges to deal with at the very start of his Presidential term. The 2021 storming of the Capitol might be eventually seen as an isolated incident, but it is the exclamation mark on one of the most controversial presidential terms ever.</p>","id":"fe2b8537-744a-59b1-bcfa-a8c2edf3ae7b","fields":{"slug":"9-january-2021-the-storming-of-the-us-capitol"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-02-09","title":"9 January 2021: The Storming of the US Capitol","category":"Politics","tags":["US Capitol","Insurrection"],"banner":"/assets/bg/politics-bg.jpg"},"timeToRead":3},{"excerpt":"Amazon is the global leader in e-commerce and cloud-based computing,with the Amazon store and Amazon Web Services dominating their respective industries.

The Jeff Bezos-led company has a publishing arm, a television studio and has started challenging Netflix in the streaming service domain. Amazon additionally produces consumer electronics like the Kindle, Amazon Echo, Fire tablets and Fire TV.</p>\n<p>Microsoft is one of the two big names in console gaming, occupies a substantial share of the desktop software market through Windows and also has the second-largest cloud computing market share through Microsoft Azure.</p>\n<p>Facebook is the dominant company when it comes to social networking, online media sharing through Instagram and YouTube. It is a significant presence in instant messaging, with WhatsApp becoming more popular day by day.</p>\n<p>Apple and Google share the entire market for mobile operating systems between themselves. Google has 72% of the market through Android, Apple has the remaining 27%. Google bought Android in 2005 to get into the mobile OS business, and it has since beaten established competitors like BlackBerry and even Microsoft’s Windows Phone. Google is also the undisputed leader in online search engines.</p>\n<p>Reading this might have made one realise just how prevalent these companies have become in our consumer lives without us catching on. Perhaps unfortunately, this is just the tip of the iceberg. The list goes on and on. How exactly have these companies succeeded in whichever market they venture into? According to a growing number of experts as well as some members of the US Congress, the path these industry giants took to reach this unparalleled success might well have been one of depravity.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n* * * *\n</p>\nThe word Big Tech is being thrown around a lot these days, and while most people are fairly familiar with the terminology by now, we’ll revisit it once more merely for the sake of starting this pivotal and extremely important story from the right place.\n<p>Big Tech refers to the five companies which dominate nearly every field of technology and share practically the entire market among themselves: Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft. Each of these companies has established themselves as the unrivalled leader in their respective industries, and each of them is also actively building towards a future where they have no serious challenge from any prospective or ambitious competitor. The problem with this vision isn’t the vision itself: monopolies are actually allowed under current US law. The part which is stirring up controversy and attracting unwanted attention is the method which these companies are using to achieve this vision. Are they really going too far to snuff out competition? Are they using their current dominance in their industry to ensure a future where there is no one left to dominate?</p>\n<p>These are some of the questions which are being asked increasingly frequently, and arriving at the answers is easier said than done. A substantial portion of the solution depends on how antitrust laws are interpreted, and to what extent research - on markets, rivals and their products - can be deemed as part of normal tactics and not of anti-competitive ones.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n* * * *\n</p>\nIn 1998, Microsoft was sued by the US government for using anti-competitive practices to eradicate competition. The lawsuit stated that Microsoft was wrongly using its dominance in the market to create a monopoly and remove any threats to its position. It alleged that Microsoft had intentionally made it difficult to install and use rival software on Windows computers and laptops.\n<p>Antitrust laws ensure one company doesn’t control or take over the market and doesn’t inflate prices accordingly. Microsoft had bundled additional programs into Windows software which was a loss for rival companies, and this was the crux of the argument against Microsoft. For example, when it started to give its browser software - Internet Explorer - for free, its top competitor Netscape failed to sustain itself and collapsed.</p>\n<p>While the lawsuit remained controversial with many saying there wasn’t any case against Microsoft at all, the presiding judge ruled that the antitrust charges were indeed true and that Microsoft had created a monopoly in the industry that threatened competition as well as innovation. The company was asked to break up into two entities, one with the operating software and the other constituting the software arm.</p>\n<p>However, Microsoft appealed against the ruling and consequently, the appeals court overturned the original decision. The Department of Justice made an agreement with Microsoft which asked the company to share its computing interfaces with other companies in the industry instead of breaking up.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n* * * *\n</p>\nThe Big Tech companies (except Microsoft as of now) are facing exactly what Bill Gates’ company faced in 1998, except that there is much more data that can be used against them this time. It is worth noting, however, that the digital landscape has also changed at a rapid rate and it can be reasonably argued that current laws don’t monitor and regulate anti-competitive practices as they should be doing.\n<p>After investigating the Big Tech companies for 16 months, a report led by US House lawmakers concluded in October 2020 that all of them (excluding Microsoft) had used their dominance in their industry to remove competition. Amazon, Apple, Facebook and Google are all accused of controlling prices and distributing goods and services in a biased manner. The committee report claims that these companies reduce the business for third party competitors - like sellers on Amazon or app developers on Android and iOS - thus trying to end any serious competition to their own business. The report’s claims include but are not limited to the following:</p>\n<p>Amazon uses seller data to understand which products sell better and which ones Amazon should itself start to produce and sell.  37% of sellers on Amazon rely on the company as their only source of income, binding them to Amazon and forcing them to put up with tactics like these which Amazon uses to promote its own products while reducing business for these sellers.</p>\n<p>Apple (mis)uses its ownership of the App Store to obtain “completely sensitive information” about third-party apps. This helps them to understand which kind of services are in demand. Apple then integrates these into its own services.</p>\n<p>Facebook used user data from its private networking app Onavo. The company then used this data to identify WhatsApp as a hugely popular alternative, and a competitor. Facebook consequently acquired WhatsApp in 2014.</p>\n<p>Similarly, the report says that Google used search and Gmail statistics to understand what kind of web browsers are more popular. This gave them a significant advantage when they launched Google Chrome. Since then, Chrome has become the most popular browser option by quite some distance. Google allegedly increases the degree of this monopoly using information from third-party sites like Yelp to improve its search results. Chrome now sends its own user data to Google, allowing Google to now use browser data to understand the demand for other services better. This potentially allows them to dominate in whichever industry or domain they want.</p>\n<p align=\"center\">\n* * * *\n</p>\nAll four companies have completely rejected the findings of the committee. Amazon said that these “uninformed notions” could instead harm small businesses and sellers using the e-commerce company as a platform. Apple “vehemently” disagreed with the report. Facebook said that its mergers with Instagram and WhatsApp weren’t anti-competitive in any way. The company also added that its acquisition of WhatsApp was cleared by the government earlier and so it saw no reason for another investigation into the same matter.\n<p>The Democrats present in the Congress recommended reforming antitrust laws, substantial restructuring for these big companies and making it illegal for them to preferentially show their own products (like Google shows its products first in search results). However, a large number of Republicans refused to consider any of these reforms, especially those involving restructuring the companies and their business models; suggesting that Congress is divided over this controversial issue and that there might be several obstacles to overcome on the road to reforming the laws concerned.</p>\n<p>The five Big Tech companies have created a world where it is practically impossible to live without being surrounded and even overwhelmed by their products and services. They have created near-perfect market intelligence such that there is no practical way for a competitor to even challenge them for a prolonged period of time. The concerned laws seem outdated in any case; several experts have stated that they do not appropriately address several areas due to the rapid advancement and change in the digital world. It remains to be seen whether this leads to a drastic change in policy which will curb these companies from taking over the market, or instead permit greater freedom business-wise; it is absolutely certain, however, that it will lead to a change in policy, for better or for worse.</p>","id":"7b929afd-ec81-5532-b7c0-559d564ee8b8","fields":{"slug":"17-january-2021-big-tech-outdated-laws-or-illicit-practices"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2021-01-17","title":"17 January 2021 Big Tech: Outdated Laws or Illicit Practices?","category":"Politics","tags":["Technology","Amazon","Government"],"banner":"/assets/bg/politics-bg.jpg"},"timeToRead":6}],"categoryName":"Politics"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3824141623"]}
