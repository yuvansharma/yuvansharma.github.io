A diagram of the 6-state No-Quarantine model is shown below. We start with a population of 10,000 people, and we allow both healthy and sick to stay in one place with no quarantine or isolation at all. This means healthy individuals first contract the virus and are contagious without showing symptoms, contagious people eventually show symptoms, symptomatic people fall sick, sick people become critical, and some critically ill people die. We increment these 6-states into discrete 1-day timesteps. The probability of a person remaining in the same state is 0.9, and the probability of transitioning to the next state is 0.1. I obtained the graph for the Markov chain using Google Sheets, where I multiplied the probabilities of each transition with the number of people in that state for each day, and then plotted the graph of each day’s numbers. If we simulate this Markov chain, all people will eventually die, which is not a favorable scenario at all. This is shown in the results graph below:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Image1.png\" alt=\"The Markov Chain\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nThe Markov Chain\n</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Image2.png\" alt=\"The Markov Chain\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\">\nThe Graph for the Markov Chain\n</p>\n<p>Conclusions: In the first 7 days, 3000 people become contagious without knowing, only 1000 people show symptoms and there is only one death.

From the first example, we see that if people do not quarantine at all, the virus can spread really fast and affect almost the entire population. This is of increased relevance in countries who have successfully countered the first wave of infections and are reopening. Returning to normal life without any precautions at all can have disastrous consequences. By quarantining just half of the total symptomatic population each day, we can save a huge number of people. Thus, this model shows how different decisions can have a huge impact on the result of the same situation, and how we must stay vigilant in order to minimize the damage caused by this pandemic.</p>","id":"ec83c840-b4f0-56cf-a4a1-1f5be121ab36","fields":{"slug":"20-feb-2020-modelling-the-coronavirus-using-markov-chains"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2020-02-20","title":"20 Feb 2020: Modelling the Coronavirus using Markov Chains","category":"Coding","tags":["Technology","Coronavirus","Markov Chains"],"banner":"/assets/bg/computer-bg-1.jpg"},"timeToRead":3},{"excerpt":"Introduction The final project for my ATDP 2019 Astronomy and Astrophysics Course revolved around wormholes and the possibility of their existence.

It is most often visualised as a tunnel connecting two different points in the four-dimensional region of spacetime. </p>\n<p>I elaborated on the three main kinds of wormholes, their structure and the possibility of their existence with the help of models as follows:</p>\n<p><em>Einstein-Rosen bridges</em>: These are connections between areas of space that can be modelled as vacuum solutions to the Einstein field equations. Einstein-Rosen bridges work on the principles of a black hole, and its complete opposite, a white hole. The black hole takes matter in, as it normally does in the universe. A white hole is the exact opposite of a black hole(which means no matter can enter it), so it spews matter outwards. These are unlikely to exist since there are no possible processes that may form white holes.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Wormhole1.jpg\" alt=\"Einstein-Rosen Bridge\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\"> An Einstein-Rosen Bridge</p>\n<p><em>String Theory Wormholes</em>: String theory wormholes are said to connect through strings called cosmic strings, which also keep them open. String theory wormholes were (probably) made during the Big Bang when quantum fluctuations (the temporary change in the amount of energy in a point in space) at the smallest scale (the Planck length- 1035 m) created many traversable wormholes. Then, by cosmic inflation, which was the rapid expansion of the universe just after the Big Bang, these wormholes increased in size, to the macroscopic scale, and were cast light-years apart in the interstellar medium. </p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/Wormhole2.jpg\" alt=\"String Theory Wormhole\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\"> String Theory Wormhole</p>\n<p><em>Manmade Wormholes</em>: Man-made wormholes are created by propping open holes in spacetime, and keeping them open. This is done using exotic matter (matter with negative mass). So, instead of the attractive force of gravity, it will exert a repulsive force which could prop open wormholes. </p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>I had a lot of fun working on this project since it involved a lot of research, cross-referencing and comparing different information.

Instead of the regular H-H nuclear fusion that occurs and releases energy in stars,\nbrown dwarfs primarily have lithium and deuterium fusion since they don’t quite have the temperature and density required for regular nuclear fusion. Brown dwarfs are very cool and hence\ndim. So, searching for them is difficult, even though they are thought to be more abundant than stars. The WISE telescope searched for IR radiation to identify brown dwarfs since most of the\nlight they emit is infrared.</p>\n<p>A ULIRG is a galaxy which primarily emits infrared light. The primary source of this IR light is dust, which is observed wherever stars are forming. Thus, ULIRGs may be found in galaxies which\nare merging and leading to bursts of star formation, which leads to collection of dust. ULIRGs emit even more light than brown dwarfs at the lower IR wavelengths.</p>\n<h2 id=\"approach\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#approach\" aria-label=\"approach permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Approach</h2>\n<p>We started this assignment by downloading the required images from the WISE Image Service. We downloaded the same image in three different wavelength bands, w1 (3.4 µm), w2 (4.6 µm) and w3\n(12 µm). We then used a finder chart to locate 12 different stars on all the 3 wavelengths. This was particularly difficult since some stars were harder to locate on specific wavelengths due to the\nchange in their brightness and intensity as the wavelength changed. It was also very confusing in the beginning.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/WiseImage.png\" alt=\"The WISE Image\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\"> The WISE Image</p>\n<p>Using each star’s coordinates and its intensity, we calculated the ratio of the intensities for the different wavelengths. We used the ratios w3:w2 and w2:w1. I wrote a Java program for\ncalculating these values. We then plotted the colour-colour diagram(a kind of graph) for the twelve stars. We identified the brown dwarf by studying the position the stars occupied on the\ncolour-colour diagram.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/ColorColorDiagram.jpg\" alt=\"Color Color Diagram\"></p>\n<p align=\"Center\"> The Color Color Diagram</p>\n<p>Then, we repeated the same for the ULIRGs and identified the ULIRG using another colour- colour diagram. However, we then realised that the object we thought was a ULIRG could just be an\nextreme case of a brown dwarf. So, we used images of the same region from the Hubble Space Telescope(HST) to look at the object, since HST images are much more detailed. Upon intensive\nexamination, we noticed the faint trace of a spiral arm in the HST image, and this confirmed it was indeed an Ultra Luminous Infrared Galaxy.</p>\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#conclusion\" aria-label=\"conclusion permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Conclusion</h2>\n<p>This was one of my favourite assignments in this course since I applied Computer Science to Astronomy while learning new things in both fields.

Confirming our\nhypothesis using HST images was a great way to end this unique assignment.</p>","id":"923fcefc-fc29-515d-ae9a-8e984142c161","fields":{"slug":"01-aug-2019-scanning-wise-data-for-brown-dwarfs-and-ulir-gs"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-08-01","title":"01 Aug 2019: Scanning WISE Data for Brown Dwarfs and ULIRGs","category":"Coding","tags":["Astrophysics","Brown Dwarfs","ULIRG","Calculations"],"banner":"/assets/bg/computer-bg-1.jpg"},"timeToRead":2},{"excerpt":"In the summer of 2019, when the world was normal and travel was still permitted, I attended the ATDP Introduction to Astronomy and Astrophysics Course at the University of California, Berkeley.\nI went into the course with zero knowledge about the…","html":"<p>In the summer of 2019, when the world was normal and travel was still permitted, I attended the ATDP Introduction to Astronomy and Astrophysics Course at the University of California, Berkeley.\nI went into the course with zero knowledge about the subject and not knowing what to expect.\nBy the time I was on my flight back to India on July 14 and wishing the flight would land in time(since the Cricket World Cup final was due to begin half an hour after landing), I felt as if I had done a four-year course squeezed into one month, which, in fact, I kind of had. We completed a college-level coursebook in one month (12 three hour classes, to be precise) and I felt as if the course had been going on my entire life.</p>\n<p>The course began with simple enough tasks: read the chapters, discuss the chapters, take quizzes on the chapters. However, it quickly escalated so much so that at one point, I didn't know if I would be able to complete it competently. I settled into a better routine, allowing myself to study the chapters more comprehensively in order to better understand and complete the assignments. This led to a drastic increase in my interest in the subject since Astronomy is not exactly something which we are all exposed to in school. Studying different types of stars, galaxies, astronomical events more and more led to an increase in my knowledge, which automatically led me to perform better as the course progressed. I will say this, though: this course is immensely time-consuming. It requires reading about two chapters for each session, doing the assignments for the chapters of the previous session, and on top of that, we had additional projects or experiments occasionally. There is also the final project, which is fun to do since we can basically work on whatever we wanted to do. The course is worth every minute you spend on it since each of these minutes is spent on expanding your knowledge of this subject that keeps on becoming increasingly engrossing. There are also fun activities, like measuring the height of the Sather Tower, and visiting the Chabot Space and Science Center for a field trip. This was especially interesting since we were, for the first time, able to apply our recently acquired knowledge of different lenses, mirrors, telescopes and see it work in real life. I and a couple of friends also talked to other visitors and space enthusiasts about various much-debated topics in the astronomical field. We obviously couldn't leave without taking photos, though, so here you go:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/ReviewImage1.jpg\" alt=\"Telescope Image\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\"> The Chabot Center Telescope</p>\n<p><img src=\"/assets/bg/ReviewImage2.jpg\" alt=\"Telescope Image\"></p>\n<p align=\"center\"> The Chabot Center Telescope</p>\n<p>Overall, I think I had spent the summer in the \"perfect\" manner(I think it's obvious from whose perspective I am speaking here). Jokes apart, though, I actually did enjoy this summer immensely, since I learnt, had fun, made new friends, ate a lot of pizza(and I mean a lot) and of course, watched the Cricket World Cup. It was a once in a lifetime experience,  and an exceptionally good one at that. (Except for the day when my mother tried to make pancakes from some weird multigrain flour, and if my stomach could speak, it would tell you its misery for the following day personally. but since it can't, let's just say it had the following reaction:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">                 </code></pre></div>","id":"41a20a1a-165b-515b-81a6-2e139c37563d","fields":{"slug":"31-july-2019-review-of-summer-program-atdp"},"frontmatter":{"date":"2019-07-31","title":"31 July 2019: Review of Summer Program ATDP","category":"Coding","tags":["Summer Program","ATDP","UC Berkeley","Astronomy","Astrophysics"],"banner":"/assets/bg/computer-bg-1.jpg"},"timeToRead":2}],"categoryName":"Coding"}},"staticQueryHashes":["3824141623"]}
